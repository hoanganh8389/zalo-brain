## [Unreleased]

### Module diagnostic pages are dev-only - 2026-09-28

> Stamp: `[2026-09-28 Claude Opus 5.5]` · docs: `core/knowledge/docs/CORE-REDUCTION-WP-13-DIAGNOSTICS-DEV-LOCAL.md` §20

The Channel Gateway and CRM sprint diagnostic pages, the Channel Gateway phase-0.37 page, the TwinChat pro-learning page and the nine TwinWeb probes are now local-development only: they are listed in `bin/dev-only-paths.txt` and `.gitignore`. The two sprint pages ran smoke actions that insert and delete rows in production tables.

**Fixes:**
- TwinChat checks that its diagnostic page exists before loading it, so servers do not log `missing_file` on every admin request.
- The CRM Settings page shows the "Sprint Diagnostic" link only when that page is installed.

**Behaviour change:** the KG public API token (`bizcity_kg_public_api_token`) could only be set from the Channel Gateway sprint page. On servers it is now set with `wp option update`.

Not deployed.

### Dev-only boundary is now checked mechanically; TwinChat report button removed - 2026-09-28

> Stamp: `[2026-09-28 Claude Opus 5.5]` · docs: `core/knowledge/docs/CORE-REDUCTION-WP-13-DIAGNOSTICS-DEV-LOCAL.md` §19

**New checks:**
- `bin/validate-dev-only-boundary.mjs`, which also runs in CI, fails when production code loads a Diagnostics or test file without checking that it exists, or uses a Diagnostics-only class without `class_exists()`.
- `bin/simulate-production-tree.mjs` checks the tree a server receives before a deploy.

**Fixes:**
- `uninstall.php` checks that the Diagnostics registry exists before loading it.
- TwinChat's "Gửi báo cáo" button in the Add Source dialog posted to the Diagnostics endpoint, which does not exist on servers. It is removed. Error messages now say to contact the administrator.

Not deployed.

### Diagnostics is a local development tool only (R-DIAG-LOCAL) - 2026-09-28

> Stamp: `[2026-09-28 Claude Opus 5.5]` · docs: `docs/rules/PHASE-0-RULE-DIAGNOSTICS-DEV-LOCAL.md`, `core/knowledge/docs/DEPLOY-WP13-WP14-20260928.md`

`core/diagnostics/`, `tests/` and `_notes/` stay in the local development workspace. They are never uploaded to a server and never committed.

**Where it is recorded:**
- `bin/dev-only-paths.txt` lists these paths as the upload exclusion list.
- `.gitignore` now also ignores `/_notes/`.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` has a new "R-DIAG-LOCAL" section. It reaches Copilot directly, Codex through `AGENTS.md`, and Claude Code through `CLAUDE.md`.

**Also updated:**
- The public R-DCL instructions now point at `core/helper/schema/changelog/`.
- The VPS SSH diagnostics runbook is marked superseded.
- The WP-13 deploy no longer uploads shims into `core/diagnostics/`. Instead, the VPS copy is moved out inside a maintenance window.

### Channel Gateway only connects channels: Marketing and Hệ thống screens removed - 2026-09-28

> Stamp: `[2026-09-28 Claude Opus 5.5]` · docs: `core/channel-gateway/docs/CORE-REDUCTION-WP-14-CHANNEL-GATEWAY-SCOPE.md` §9

**Removed from the Channel Gateway admin app:**
- The whole Marketing group: Campaigns, QR Link, Broadcast, Công việc, Tự động hoá CSKH and Community Gallery. CRM and Automation own these features, or the owner retired them.
- The whole Hệ thống group: Thông báo, the duplicate "Cài đặt chung" (Bot Studio's "Cấu hình vận hành" is the same screen), Sprint Diagnostic, and the dead Webhook Inspector and "Phase plan" links.
- Result: the bundle is 156 KB smaller. Old bookmarks land on the overview.

**Also retired:**
- The Notification Center (settings screen, REST and dispatcher). Admin alerts for Woo orders and stock, CF7, new users, comments, published posts and Zalo bridge state stop.
- The Zalo bridge `/health-alert` route now answers `200 notifications_retired` instead of failing with 503.
- `/web/ai-compose` and `/web/publisher/force`, which were used only by Công việc.

**Kept or moved:**
- The broadcast engine stays in Channel Gateway, because CRM Broadcast runs on it. Its two tables are now declared in the schema changelog (1.9.0).
- The Flow → Campaign auto-import now runs when the CRM page opens, not when a channel screen opens.
- TwinBrain's progress-notice settings keep working.

Harness 30/30 with mutation proofs. Not deployed.

### Bot-document fonts subset to Latin + Vietnamese (−64 %) - 2026-09-28

> Stamp: `[2026-09-28 Claude Opus 5.5]` · docs: `core/channel-gateway/docs/CORE-REDUCTION-WP-14-CHANNEL-GATEWAY-SCOPE.md` §5

`core/channel-gateway/assets/fonts/NotoSans-{Regular,Bold}.ttf` are read by the server-side tFPDF renderer that produces bot-document PDFs. Browsers never load them, and Google Fonts cannot replace them. They were subset to Latin, Vietnamese, punctuation, currency and common symbols: 1.25 MB → 453 KB. Per-character widths through tFPDF are identical for 233 Vietnamese business characters in both styles. Greek and Cyrillic glyphs are no longer included. `OFL.txt` is kept. No code changed. The originals are in `_notes/core-reduction-snapshot-20260928-wp14-f1-fonts.tar.gz`. Not deployed.

### Two tables were quarantined only through core/diagnostics - 2026-09-28

> Stamp: `[2026-09-28 Claude Sonnet 5]` · docs: `core/knowledge/docs/CORE-REDUCTION-WP-13-DIAGNOSTICS-DEV-LOCAL.md` §17–§18

`bizcity_webchat_sessions` and `bizcity_webchat_conversations` were marked quarantine-only (install blocked, writes refused) only in the Diagnostics table catalog; `BizCity_Legacy_Table_Policy`'s own lists did not carry them, and its `is_legacy()` reached the catalog through a `class_exists` fallback. Deleting `core/diagnostics` (D-35) would have silently removed that protection. Fixed by adding both tables to the policy's own `$quarantine`/`$writer_stop_defaults` arrays — same behavior, no dependency on Diagnostics. Static and harness evidence only; not deployed.

### REST errors recorded to JSONL; TwinSearch report button removed; CI follows D-35 - 2026-09-28

> Stamp: `[2026-09-28 Claude Opus 5.5]` · docs: `core/knowledge/docs/CORE-REDUCTION-WP-13-DIAGNOSTICS-DEV-LOCAL.md` §15–§16

- **Error reports go to the JSONL log.** `BizCity_Error_Reporter` (same class and API) moved to `core/helper` and writes the log contract `core.helper.error_reports` (Tools → BizCity Logs, 7-day retention) instead of rewriting the wp_option `bizcity_error_reports` on every error. It now loads on every request type, so REST errors outside wp-admin are recorded for the first time. Fix hints no longer link to the Diagnostics page when it is not installed.
- **TwinSearch:** the "Gửi báo cáo" button and the links into Diagnostics are gone; error messages point to the administrator instead.
- **CI:** removed the checks for the archived `plugins/bizcity-profile`; the schema-owner check runs on public GitHub; a new guard fails the build if `core/diagnostics/` or `tests/` are ever committed.

Static and harness evidence only; not deployed.

### Schema owner leaves Diagnostics; Health Wizard removed from TwinChat - 2026-09-28

> Stamp: `[2026-09-28 Claude Opus 5.5]` · docs: `core/knowledge/docs/CORE-REDUCTION-WP-13-DIAGNOSTICS-DEV-LOCAL.md` §13–§14, `docs/diagnostics/PHASE-0-RULE-DIAGNOSTICS-CHANGELOG.md` v1.1

Decision D-35: Diagnostics runs in local development only. Two steps towards it:

- **Schema owner moved to `core/helper/schema/`.** The schema changelog (`changelog/*.json`, 148 tables), `BizCity_Diagnostics_Changelog_Loader` and `BizCity_Diagnostics_Auto_Create` create and upgrade production tables, so they are runtime, not diagnostics. Class names are unchanged; the old files in `core/diagnostics/includes/` are shims. The changelog is now committed to GitHub, so 5 phrases carrying production blog ids, a DB host name and a tenant domain were redacted. Auto-create now refuses DDL when the legacy table policy is not loaded (fail-closed). New checks: `bin/validate-schema-owner.mjs`, `bin/scan-private-identity.mjs`. **Edit schema JSON only in `core/helper/schema/changelog/`.**
- **TwinChat Health Wizard removed** (component, three mount points, rebuilt `ui/dist`). It called `bizcity-diagnostics/v1` and showed a mock probe list when that failed.

Static and harness evidence only; not deployed. Deploy order for the schema move: the two `core/diagnostics/includes` shims first, then `core/helper/schema/`, then `core/helper/bootstrap.php` and the two installers.

### Production code survives without Diagnostics (WP-13 DL-1) - 2026-09-27

> Stamp: `[2026-09-27 Claude Opus 5.5]` · doc: `core/knowledge/docs/CORE-REDUCTION-WP-13-DIAGNOSTICS-DEV-LOCAL.md` §12

- **Fixed a latent fatal** in the automation installer: it declared the Diagnostics folder present whether or not it existed, then required a missing file. Harmless while the folder is deployed; an HTTP 500 on the first schema check without it. Reproduced on the old code, gone on the new.
- The REST error trait loads from its owner (`core/helper`), no longer through a Diagnostics shim.
- Channel Gateway and CRM diagnostic pages are optional: loaded only when present, through `BizCity_Safe_Loader`.
- `wp bizcity health` without the Diagnostics engine reports `skip` / `diagnostics_package_absent` instead of failing.
- Admin links and cards to the Diagnostics page appear only when the page exists (`bizcity_diagnostics_available()`, new in `core/helper`).

No behaviour changes while `core/diagnostics/` is present. Evidence: new harness 20/20 against a mirror without the folder, 233/233 across all harnesses, 36/36 validators. Not deployed; `core/diagnostics/` must stay on the VPS until WP-13 DL-6.

### Diagnostics becomes a dev-only tool (plan) and WP-12 is deployed - 2026-09-27

> Stamp: `[2026-09-27 Claude Opus 5.5]` · docs: `core/knowledge/docs/CORE-REDUCTION-WP-13-DIAGNOSTICS-DEV-LOCAL.md`, `core/knowledge/docs/CORE-REDUCTION-WP-12-ARCHIVE-CONTENT-TOOLS-SKILLS-LEGACY.md` §24–§25

- **WP-12 deployed to the VPS** (owner report). Runtime checks are not yet recorded, so its status is `DEPLOYED`, not `RUNTIME_PASS`. Since the manifest, D-33 retired the Telegram customer channel and the dead Skills tab was removed from the TwinShell ActivityBar.
- **Owner decision D-35:** Diagnostics (engine, probes, diagnostic admin pages, `bizcity-diagnostics/v1`) runs only in local development — not on GitHub, not on the VPS — and produces simulated results against the framework contracts and rules. This supersedes the 2026-09-25 entry below where Diagnostics stayed on the VPS, and WP-06's plan for a package installed on sites.
- **Not yet safe to remove from the VPS.** Measured: seven production installers create and upgrade their tables through the Diagnostics auto-create service (removing it would silently stop table creation on new blogs), and the automation installer has a latent fatal when the folder is missing. WP-13 orders the work: guard fixes, move the schema owner into runtime code, a production-tree simulation gate, a staging proof, and only then removal.

No code changed in this entry.

### CORE-REDUCTION WP-12 — archive the four legacy core folders, shape `core/` around the BizTwin CRM axis, and codify the sweep protocol - 2026-09-27

> Stamp: `[2026-09-27 Claude Sonnet 5]` · docs: `core/knowledge/docs/CORE-REDUCTION-WP-12-ARCHIVE-CONTENT-TOOLS-SKILLS-LEGACY.md`, `docs/rules/PHASE-0-RULE-ONE-AXIS.md`, `docs/rules/PHASE-0-RULE-BIZTWIN-CRM-AXIS.md`, `docs/rules/PHASE-0-RULE-REDUCTION-AUDIT-PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/audits/CORE-REDUCTION-FINDINGS-LEDGER.md`

Owner directive: `core/content-ops`, `core/tools`, `core/skills` and `core/helper-legacy` were confirmed out of scope for the product's core value and safe to remove; a series of follow-up decisions (D-29..D-34) then retired the Zalo Hotline admin channel and the Telegram admin bot, and asked for `core/` to be reshaped around one axis: Channel Gateway → BizTwin CRM → Context Bank → KG Hub → TwinBrain → Twin Core → MCP.

- **R0–R4**: the four legacy folders moved to `core/_archived/`, with every dependency (SMTP, the Journal entry store, the Automation slash-command matcher, several send functions) migrated to a live owner first. Zero fatals; runtime deploy pending.
- **R5–R10**: `plugins/bizcity-zalo-bizcity` (Zalo Hotline, D-29) and the Telegram admin-bot adapter (D-30) retired; a duplicate event emitter and an unauthenticated Telegram webhook stub were found and closed in the process (not caused by this wave, but only visible once the surrounding code was read line by line).
- **R11–R12b**: 93 `*_deleted.php` retired-class files consolidated under `core/_archived/_deleted/`; SQL tables owned only by archived modules marked `quarantine_only` (deprecated, left to go orphan/empty) rather than dropped, per the owner's softened D-31.
- **R13/R13a/R13b/R13e**: new machine-readable axis contract (`docs/contracts/BIZTWIN-CRM-AXIS-v1.json`) classifies every `core/` folder into a tier and reports coupling for anything not on the axis; `core/research` migrated into `modules/twinsearch/research`, `core/twinsearch` (a shared KG document-search engine, not dead code) migrated into `core/kg-hub`; `plugins/bizcity-profile` (confirmed inactive by the owner) archived.
- **New standing rule R-REDUCTION-AUDIT**: the 6-round sweep protocol this wave used (tarball+sha256 baseline, symbol audit, path/hook/registry audit, move+re-verify, validator diff, runtime proof) is now mandatory for every future reduction/archive/deprecation wave, not just this one.
- **New Findings Ledger** (`docs/audits/CORE-REDUCTION-FINDINGS-LEDGER.md`, generated by `bin/generate-reduction-findings-ledger.mjs`): the 44 findings this wave produced (data-ownership traps, load-order fatals avoided, a security-relevant webhook stub, silent-behaviour-change shims, harness false-passes, and more) are now a single citable, `file:line`-sourced index for future audits — instead of narrative prose someone has to re-read in full.
- **New validator `bin/validate-archive-completeness.mjs`**: mechanically checks that no live file anywhere in `core/`, `modules/`, `plugins/`, `includes/` requires a path under `_archived/`, and that every row in the plugin contract registry still points at a path that exists and is not archived. First run: PASS, 0 findings across 1561 scanned files and 12 registry rows.

Static + harness evidence only (`php -l`, `validate-php74.php`, the full `bin/validate-*.mjs` suite, 6 hand-rolled PHP harnesses covering R0–R13, all green); this wave has not been deployed or exercised at runtime.

### CI evidence boundary — private test and diagnostics files are not published - 2026-09-25

> Stamp: `[2026-09-25 Claude Sonnet 5]` · workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

`core/diagnostics/` (engine, schema changelog, probes) and the top-level `tests/` tree (PHPUnit, fixtures, baselines) stay in the private workspace and on the VPS for internal testing. They are **not published to GitHub**.

The workflow detects them (`detect` job) and gates every step that reads them: with the files present (a full workspace or a self-hosted runner) the step runs; without them (public GitHub) it is **SKIPPED**. **SKIP is not PASS**: a green public run does **not** verify the skipped gates, and the `evidence-boundary` job prints, in every run summary, which gates ran and which were skipped.

Not verified by a public GitHub run: PHPUnit contract tests (`composer test`); every `*-fixtures` validator; the ownership / parity validators that need a `tests/fixtures/*/baseline.json` (DDL table parity, capability receipts, manifest capability parity, channel zone and identity, CRM ownership and contracts, file-first channel logging, sender ownership, Context Bank / KG ownership, TwinBrain vertical bridge ownership, provider gateway isolation, Brain retrieval facade ownership, KG reranker ownership); legacy table lifecycle gates; R-DCL schema changelog validation; the Diagnostics CLI runner (mock mode), `wp bizcity health` and the framework smoke. The ownership validators are gated, not weakened: without their baseline they would report every known item as new.

Always run, public or private: public contract JSON and fixtures, SDK build and release metadata, plugin contract registry, agent-instruction parity, framework contract audit, R-SAFE-LOADER bootstrap rule, PHP 7.4 / 8.1 / 8.2 syntax, PHP 7.4 compatibility and R-GW-8 grep guards, the shipped-tree static checks, the strict JSONL parity scan, the reference-plugin diagnostics check, HOOKS.md coverage, SDK package smoke.

Release claim: a build published from GitHub is **not** labelled as verified for the skipped gates. Runtime-sensitive evidence comes from the private workspace / VPS runs, the separate Diagnostics package and the browser self-check (`docs/tools/core-reduction-selfcheck.js`).

### PHASE-0.60A/B/C/D — Bot Studio: AI assistant replies on Zalo Personal - 2026-09-23

> Stamp: `[2026-09-23 05:40 PM Claude Fable 5.1]` · docs: `core/channel-gateway/docs/PHASE-0.60A..D-*.md`

- **0.60A (engine, `core/channel-gateway/includes/bot/`)** — turn claim at
  `bizcity_channel_normalized` priority 0 turns the Automation Default_Reply net
  off for that request only; a workflow enqueued in the same request makes the bot
  yield; the turn runs on a debounced cron with a per-thread lock (park, never
  queue), builds context from persona + source-labelled contact facts + N recent
  CRM messages under a char budget, runs a bounded JSON tool plan, and sends
  through `BizCity_CRM_Outbound_Dispatcher` with `responder_kind=auto` (Inbox 🤖,
  zero ConversationDetail change). Provider dead → one honest sentence, never
  silence. Hybrid mode stores a private-note draft instead of sending.
- **0.60A REST** (`bizcity-channel/v1/bot/*`): runtime, tuning (registry-driven,
  reset-to-default), tools, provider, queue/status, context/preview — four-field errors.
- **0.60A UI**: GuruQuickEditSheet (AI-source cards, notebook bypass, context
  source, tool table with capability toggles, 1API gap warning, real test call);
  ZaloPersonalGuruPanel (office hours, pause-on-manual, @mention, per-number tool
  policy, bridge-not-ready lock); SettingsRoute tuning card; HealthRoute queue card;
  `/gpt/` MyChannels bot toggle + hours (member-scoped REST).
- **0.60B (CRM)**: R-DCL drift fix for `bizcity_crm_contacts`; `birthday DATE` +
  `birthday_md CHAR(5)` (indexed, MySQL 5.7-safe); Zalo profile enrichment on a
  one-shot cron (fill-only-empty, source+time, 1/day throttle, group threads
  skipped, opt-out); `contact_birthday` Scheduler event + adapter (staff note by
  default, customer greeting opt-in under the bot's daily cap); ContactDrawer
  "🤖 Ngữ cảnh cho trợ lý" RailSection; contacts REST bot-context/enrich/birthday/enrichment.
- **0.60C**: site-level dual AI source (1API default / external) via the existing
  `bizcity_llm_mode`; four-branch resolution contract with "missing key → ignore
  override"; end-anchored host match; TTS/STT/music declared as 1API gaps.
- **0.60D**: contact-scoped astro tool (ask once, VN date normaliser, save as
  `customer_stated`, never the logged-in user); vertical tools from the canonical
  registry ∩ `allowed_verticals` (sensitive/guest-blocked/plan-gated excluded,
  disclaimers survive Zalo trimming); automation yield + `bizcity_bot_turn_completed`.
- New generic hook `bizcity_crm_message_inserted` at the single CRM insertion point.
- Tests: 8 new unit files (79 Bot* + 6 enrichment); probe `core.channel.bot_studio` extended.

### HOTFIX — CRM is a mandatory Twin AI bundled runtime - 2026-09-22

- Removed the CRM entrypoint's silent early return for a missing/relocated
  `class-inbox-access.php`; CRM now follows the Twin AI bundled must-load path.
- The Twin AI loader no longer treats `BIZCITY_CRM_VERSION` alone as proof that
  the CRM runtime is current. It verifies the CRM must-load contract and loads
  CRM during the TwinChat admin-shell request because the central admin menu
  consumes CRM-owned surface descriptors there.
- Added a contract stamp (`BIZCITY_CRM_MUSTLOAD_CONTRACT=surfaces_for@1`) so a
  stale CRM artifact cannot masquerade as a loaded current runtime. The central
  menu still degrades safely instead of fatalling when an older deployment is
  encountered.

### HOTFIX — non-stream TwinBrain leaked SSE `event: debug` into later output - 2026-09-18

- **Symptom:** with the Twin debug gate on, the diagnostics CLI's `--format=json`
  stdout started with `event: web_research_started` / `event: debug …` lines
  before the JSON document (58 KB `run-1.json` that no parser could read). The
  same mechanism can inject SSE text into the body of any later response in a
  non-stream request (REST/webhook/automation) that runs web research.
- **Root cause:** `BizCity_TwinBrain_Runtime` non-stream path built
  `new BizCity_Twin_SSE_Writer( false )` inside its own `ob_start()` /
  `ob_end_clean()`. That constructor attaches a global
  `bizcity_intent_pipeline_log` debug listener that is never removed, so it kept
  echoing after the capture ended; and `emit()` always calls `ob_flush()`, which
  pushed that output through the caller's buffers.
- **Fix:** `core/twin-core/includes/class-twin-sse-writer.php` gains an explicit
  capture-only mode (`BizCity_Twin_SSE_Writer::capture()`): no debug listener,
  no `ob_flush()`/`flush()`, no heartbeat. `new BizCity_Twin_SSE_Writer( false )`
  is unchanged because TwinWeb uses it as a real stream after `open_sse()`.
  `core/twinbrain/includes/class-twinbrain-runtime.php` non-stream web research
  uses `capture()` (guarded by `method_exists`). `bin/diagnostics-run.php`
  machine-output buffer is now cleanable/removable but not flushable, so no
  future `ob_flush()` can reach stdout.
- **Validation:** standalone harness reproducing the runner/runtime buffer layout
  with the debug gate on: old writer + old buffer → stdout not valid JSON
  (205 bytes of SSE + JSON); old writer + guarded buffer → valid JSON, 171 bytes
  of chatter kept for stderr; capture writer + guarded buffer → valid JSON,
  0 listeners. `php -l` clean on the three files; `bin/validate-php74.php` PASS.
  Runtime evidence on the target is deferred until the channel batch is rerun.

### PHASE-0.48C-CRM-CONTEXT — C `/gpt/crm/` content parity with B2 `/crm/` - 2026-09-17

Closed the six content gaps found when comparing the master C surface
`/gpt/crm/` against the B2 admin surface `/crm/`. Every change keeps the C
scope identity-first and reuses the canonical CRM/bridge owners; no new table,
no provider call from the browser and no ACL widening.

**W1 — inbound sender name**

- `modules/twinweb/ui/src/pages/CrmInboxPage.tsx`: `messageSenderLabel( message, conversation )`
  now resolves the real identity instead of the hardcoded `Khách hàng`:
  message `sender_name` → group title → contact name. Outbound keeps `Bạn` /
  `Trợ lý`.
- The reply-preview bar passes the selected conversation so `Trả lời …` shows
  the same resolved name.

**W2 — per-message group member name**

- `modules/twinweb/includes/class-twinweb-rest.php`: `shape_mychannels_zalo_personal_message()`
  now exposes `thread_kind` and `sender_name` read from the canonical
  `ai_metadata_json` already written by the Zalo Personal/Bot adapters. It also
  un-nests the real delivery state from `payload_json` when the row has no
  `delivery` column value.
- `modules/twinweb/ui/src/api/myChannels.ts`: `CrmInboxMessage` declares
  `thread_kind`, `sender_name`, `attachments` and `reply_to`, and a new
  `CrmInboxAttachment` type replaces the previous untyped catch-all.

**W3 — group title**

- New bridge route `GET /wp/accounts/:id/group-info` in
  `plugins/bizcity-zalo-personal/_library/zca-bridge-main/src/wp/wpRoutes.ts`,
  backed by `ZcaAdapter.getGroupName()` and `SessionManager.getGroupName()`
  (both reuse the same `getGroupInfo` call the roster already makes).
  `BRIDGE_VERSION` bumped `0.39.8` → `0.39.9` so this image is distinguishable
  from the C8 build on the VPS.
- `ZaloApi` type and `test/wp/wpRoutes.test.ts` extended; 3 new tests cover the
  happy path, provider failure degradation and the no-session guard.
- PHP: `BizCity_Zalo_Bridge_Client::get_group_name()` +
  `BizCity_Zalo_Personal_Hub_Client::get_group_name()` (managed-mode parity).
- `class-twinweb-rest.php`: `resolve_mychannels_group_name()` reads the provider
  label server-side and persists it onto the canonical contact
  `additional_attributes` (same field the FB/Zalo ingestors already merge), then
  `shape_mychannels_zalo_personal_conversation( $row, true )` returns it as the
  C conversation title. The flag defaults to `false` so the Inbox list never
  fans out to the provider per row.
- `CrmInboxPage.tsx` merges the resolved conversation back into the list row, so
  the C header and row title match `/crm/`.

**W4 — inbound media**

- C message DTO gains a bounded `attachments[]` (`id`, `file_type`, `url`,
  `thumb_url`, `name`) built from the canonical `bizcity_crm_attachments` rows;
  the raw `data_url` / `meta_json` storage columns are never forwarded.
- Renderer draws images as `<img>` (with `thumb_url` fallback and lazy loading)
  and other files as download links. A message whose content is only media no
  longer prints the `—` placeholder.

**W5 — document list**

- `get_crm_member_documents()` now returns the CRM `crm_documents` rows **plus**
  the Zalo message-attachment inventory for the exact conversation, mirroring
  the `/crm/` `ContactDrawer` behaviour. Zalo items keep the admin label
  `Tệp từ Zalo · tin #<id>` when the provider sent no filename.
- `CrmMemberDocumentsResponse` declares `url` and `source`; the C rail renders
  an `Mở file ↗` action when a URL exists.

**W6 — composer styling**

- Composer textarea raised to `min-h-[5.75rem] max-h-[11.25rem]` with
  `text-[13px] leading-relaxed`, matching the B2 `bzc-composer-textarea`
  (`min-height:92px; max-height:180px`), and the placeholder now documents the
  Ctrl/⌘+Enter shortcut.

**Validation**

- PHP `php -l` PASS: `modules/twinweb/includes/class-twinweb-rest.php`,
  `plugins/bizcity-zalo-personal/includes/shared/class-zalo-bridge-client.php`,
  `plugins/bizcity-zalo-personal/includes/shared/class-zalo-personal-hub-client.php`.
- Bridge `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0; `vitest run` → **454 passed / 20 skipped /
  0 failed** (3 new `group-info` route tests).
- `modules/twinweb/ui` `npx tsc --noEmit`: no error in either edited file (the
  remaining diagnostics are pre-existing in `ComposerPopover`,
  `GoalSessionDetail`, `InboxConnectHub`, `SearchModeBar`).
- `modules/twinweb/ui` `npm run build` PASS — `1944 modules transformed`,
  `dist/assets/index-DTjOwnC6.js`.
- New DDV probe `modules.twin_gpt.crm_inbox_parity`
  (`core/diagnostics/includes/probes/class-probe-twinweb-crm-inbox-parity.php`,
  order 72, queued in `core/diagnostics/bootstrap.php`). Focused run
  `--filter=modules.twin_gpt.crm_member_scope,modules.twin_gpt.crm_inbox_console,modules.twin_gpt.crm_inbox_parity`
  → `verdict=pass`, `counts={pass:3,warn:0,fail:0,skip:0}`. Renderer/Dev-source
  steps degrade to `skip` on servers that ship only the built bundle (R-DDV-FE).

**Not claimed**: authenticated browser parity, VPS WordPress deploy, and a live
provider group-label read are still pending. No B2 admin Inbox behaviour changed.

### PHASE-0.39C-C8 — Zalo Personal session retention/recovery hardening (source + local runtime) - 2026-09-17

Implements the C8 wave of
[PHASE-0.39C](core/channel-gateway/docs/PHASE-0.39C-ZALO-PERSONAL-PRODUCTION-CLOSURE-ROADMAP.md).
Root cause: the sidecar marked a session `expired` on ANY boot-time restore
failure, including transient transport errors, and the CRM Inbox showed one
combined banner telling every operator to re-scan a QR even when the cookie was
still valid.

**Task 1 — restore-on-boot classification + retry**

- New `plugins/bizcity-zalo-personal/_library/zca-bridge-main/src/zalo/sessionRestore.ts`
  exporting `isZaloAuthRejection()` and `restoreAccountSession()` with
  `RESTORE_RETRY_DELAYS_MS = [0, 5000, 20000]`. Extracted from `main.ts` (a script
  with module-level side effects that exports nothing) so the logic is unit
  testable; `main.ts` imports and calls it.
- Only a real zca-js rejection (`err.name === "ZcaApiError"`) marks `expired`
  (`zalo_rejected_cookie`), and it does so on the first attempt without waiting out
  the retries. A transport-only failure after all retries leaves the DB status
  UNCHANGED so readiness can report `session_disconnected` instead of forcing a
  needless QR re-scan. Verified against the real package:
  `node_modules/zca-js/dist/cjs/Errors/ZaloApiError.cjs` sets
  `this.name = "ZcaApiError"`.

**Task 2 — session lifecycle telemetry**

- New migration `src/store/migrations/012_session_lifecycle.sql` adds
  `last_status_reason` + `last_status_changed_at`.
- `AccountRepo.updateStatus()` gained an optional `reason` (COALESCEd, so a caller
  with nothing meaningful to say does not wipe the previous explanation).
- Call sites widened: `main.ts` SessionManager `onExpired` persists the zca-js
  close reason verbatim; `qrLoginService.ts::expire()` persists
  `qr_expired`/`qr_declined`/`qr_failed`.

**Task 3 — settings restart policy: restart KEPT, with documented reason**

- The spec required verifying first whether the Chatwoot/OA clients re-read
  settings per call. Verified they do NOT: `resolveSettings()` runs once at boot
  and the clients are constructed from the resolved `cfg` (`main.ts:123/125/134`
  Chatwoot trio, `main.ts:378` `OaOAuthClient`). These fields are boot-cached, so a
  restart is genuinely required for a saved value to take effect; removing
  `onApply()` would silently make the Settings screen a no-op. The spec explicitly
  permits this outcome. Restart kept, reason documented inline under the
  `BOOT-CACHED-RESTART-REQUIRED` marker.

**Task 4a — readiness split**

- `readiness_envelope()` (`includes/shared/class-zalo-bridge-rest.php`) now reads
  `session_live`; when `session_live === false` while the DB status is still
  `connected` it reports `session_status = 'session_disconnected'`. New
  `session_live` field added; no existing field changed.

**Task 4b — UI message split**

- `modules/twinweb/ui/src/pages/CrmInboxPage.tsx` derives `sessionExpired` /
  `sessionDisconnected` / `bridgeUnavailable` separately. `sessionNeedsLogin` is
  narrowed to `sessionExpired` only, so the QR flow and `autoStartPersonalQr` no
  longer fire for a possibly-still-valid cookie; a new `sessionNeedsAttention`
  drives button/banner display. The old combined sentence is gone, replaced by
  three correctly-scoped banners (red expired / amber disconnected / amber bridge).

**Task 5 — self-diagnostics probe**

- New `core/diagnostics/includes/probes/class-probe-zalo-personal-session-retention.php`
  (`modules.zalo-personal.session_retention`, order 47), registered from
  `core/diagnostics/bootstrap.php`. Five Disk rows, emits `error` + `fix_hint` on
  failure. The restart-policy row accepts EITHER the "no restart" implementation OR
  the documented boot-cached reason, because the spec allowed both.

**Evidence (local runtime — NOT production):**

- `npx vitest run test/zalo/sessionRestore.test.ts` → `6 passed (6)`.
- `npx vitest run` (full sidecar suite) → `451 passed | 20 skipped`, `0 failed`.
  One pre-existing assertion in `test/zalo/qrLoginService.test.ts` was updated to
  expect the new `qr_expired` reason (intended Task 2 behaviour).
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0.
- Diagnostics DoD run
  `--filter=modules.zalo-personal,modules.zalo-personal.bridge_diagnostics,modules.zalo-personal.session_retention`
  → `verdict=pass`, `counts={pass:3, warn:0, fail:0, skip:0}` (PHP 7.4.4, blog 1533).
- FE build `npm run build` in `modules/twinweb/ui` → exit 0.
- PHP lint PASS on the probe, `class-zalo-bridge-rest.php`, `core/diagnostics/bootstrap.php`.

**Version bump for deploy verification:** `BRIDGE_VERSION` raised `0.39.7` →
`0.39.8` (`src/main.ts` + `wpRoutes.test.ts` fixture). Without a bump the
runbook's source grep would pass against the old checkout, so a deploy could not
be proven to run the new image. The runbook source-to-image block now greps
`0.39.8` plus the C8 markers (`restoreAccountSession`, `isZaloAuthRejection`,
`012_session_lifecycle.sql`) and lists `/app/dist/store/migrations/` to prove the
migration was packaged.

**VPS deploy — 2026-09-16 (production runtime evidence):**

- Source markers verified on `/home/vibeyeuc/zca-bridge/src/` before build
  (`BRIDGE_VERSION = "0.39.8"`, `restoreAccountSession`, `isZaloAuthRejection`,
  `012_session_lifecycle.sql`).
- Image built: `sha256:eb1b058d1afe7afb4c1e15fbbfc044f32cdd02aed14c833474c5510b868e0ede`.
- **overlay2 incident (runbook precedent 2026-09-03):** the first
  `up -d --force-recreate --no-build` failed with
  `driver "overlay2" failed to remove root filesystem: ... device or resource busy`
  and SSH dropped. `docker ps -a` showed two stale bridge containers
  (`302e5f3cd778…` Dead, `e3d58f6e3654…` Created) while `bridge-db` stayed
  `Up (healthy)`. Recovered via the runbook post-reboot block: reboot, remove only
  those two stale bridge containers, start `bridge-db`, `pg_isready` →
  `accepting connections`, `up -d --no-build zca-bridge` → `Started`. **No table,
  volume, `bridge_pg` or credential was deleted.**
- Compiled image marker: `/app/dist/main.js:67` → `const BRIDGE_VERSION = "0.39.8";`.
  `012_session_lifecycle.sql` present in `/app/dist/store/migrations/`.
- Migration applied at boot: container log `applied 012_session_lifecycle.sql`;
  `schema_migrations` lists it at `2026-09-16 14:02:14.982921+00`.
- Schema live: `zalo_accounts` now has `last_status_reason` +
  `last_status_changed_at`.
- Health: `curl -i http://127.0.0.1:4000/healthz` → `HTTP/1.1 200 OK {"ok":true}`.
  Container log shows WordPress CRM mode, `endpointRole=managed_hub_relay`,
  `tokenConfigured=true`, listening on 4000, and an external caller receiving
  `statusCode: 200` on `/wp/health`.
- **`ok:false` on the host-side `/wp/health` check was a shell artefact, not a
  bridge fault:** `BIZCITY_INBOUND_TOKEN` is a container env var and is empty in
  the host shell, so the request hit the 401 guard (`wpRoutes.ts:239`). The
  container log proves a real caller got `statusCode: 200` on the same route.

**Still open (not claimed done):** the plugin half of C8
(`class-zalo-bridge-rest.php` readiness split, `CrmInboxPage.tsx` banner split,
the new probe) is still local-only and must be deployed to the WordPress site
before the UI split is observable. No real account has yet been observed
transitioning to `session_disconnected`, and `last_status_reason` is still NULL
for existing rows (it only populates on the next status change), so the telemetry
acceptance is not yet demonstrated on live data. `coverage.complete=false` — the
diagnostics runs are focused probe sets, not a release gate.

### PHASE-0.41D-D1/D2/D3 — CRM One Brain identity + evidence-pack closure - 2026-09-16

Closed the first three evidence gaps of
[PHASE-0.41D](core/channel-gateway/docs/PHASE-0.41D-CRM-ONE-BRAIN-CLOSURE-PLAN.md).

**D1 — positive authorization.** New diagnostics-only fixture factory
`core/diagnostics/includes/fixtures/class-crm-inbox-fixture-factory.php`
(marker-scoped, repository-owned writes, marker-guarded teardown) plus probe
`modules.twin_gpt.crm_inbox_positive_projection`. Proves the exact-account C
route returns a bounded projection for an *assigned* Zone 1 inbox instead of
only proving denials. A missing fixture is a FAIL, never a SKIP.

**D2 — two-user/two-account isolation.** The factory gained
`personal_per_user`, `cross_membership` and `with_group_conversation` so a full
A/B topology can be built. Probe `core.crm.two_user_isolation` runs one 18-step
matrix over user × account × zone: business union, Personal owner-only guard,
cross-membership cannot widen Personal, foreign business/Personal/care denial,
owner Personal allowed, Context Bank same-envelope-different-verdict, B2
selected-user scope not tenant-wide, `manage_options` on the C surface not
tenant-wide, group thread carries no member phone, phone correlation
deterministic.

**D3 — Context Retrieval Pack.** New canonical builder
`core/context-bank/includes/class-context-bank-retrieval-pack.php` composing
scope resolver → bounded search → per-pointer authorization → rollup registry →
KG candidate policy into a schema-valid `context-retrieval-pack@1.x`. It never
throws: fail-closed means a valid empty pack with `degraded=true`. Budgets read
from the resolved scope and can only be narrowed by a request. New public v1
fixture `context-retrieval-pack.context-bank.degraded.json`. Probe
`core.context_bank.retrieval_pack`.

**Finding (determinism):** ledger search is bounded by a wall-clock budget, so a
cold-cache build returns fewer rows than a warm-cache build. `query_id` is
always stable, but the evidence set is only comparable when both builds
completed. The determinism check now flags an incomplete build explicitly rather
than allowing a silent divergence; D4 must only compare parity on complete packs.

**Evidence:** D1 `1 pass / 9 steps`, D2 `1 pass / 18 steps`, D3 `1 pass /
10 steps`, all PHP 7.4.4 `--skip-provision --skip-network`. Regression batch
across the Context Bank owners plus menu/CRM probes: `10 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip`.
Public contract suite: `CONTRACT TEST PASS (26 contracts)`.

**Also in this window:** `PHASE-0-SETTING-PANEL-G6-HOTFIX3` — the Twin Brain
wp-admin menu no longer disappears while inside the TwinChat admin shell; menu
registration moved out of the shell-gated runtime bootstrap into
`core/twinbrain/includes/class-twinbrain-admin-menu.php`, guarded by
`core.admin_menu.twin_brain_owner`.

### PHASE-0.41D-D4 — One Brain / KG-MCP parity facade - 2026-09-16

Added `core/twinbrain/includes/class-brain-retrieval-facade.php` as the shared
server-authorized read boundary for Twin GPT and MCP. It delegates to the D3
Context Retrieval Pack builder and never reads Context Bank ledger/JSONL, CRM or
Woo directly. Added read-only `brain.context.search`,
`brain.context.evidence` and `brain.order.summary` MCP tools; all three default
OFF until parity/canary evidence passes. Added probe
`core.brain.kg_mcp_parity`.

Local evidence: D4 `1 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip`, 8/8 steps; D1-D4 + Context Bank
regression `11 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip`; public contract suite `26 contracts`
PASS. VPS SSH evidence is `DEFERRED` because `libedemo.bizcity.vn:22` timed out
from the current environment. No production readiness claim is made.

### PHASE-0-SETTING-PANEL-G6-HOTFIX3 — Twin Brain menu vanished inside the TwinChat shell - 2026-09-16

Reported: opening `admin.php?page=bizcity-twinchat#/setting-panel/workspace`
made the whole **Twin Brain** wp-admin menu disappear.

**Root cause (not lazy-load of the panel):**

- The Twin Brain parent + submenus were registered inside
  `core/twinbrain/bootstrap.php` (`admin_menu` @30).
- `bizcity-twin-ai.php` gates that bootstrap behind
  `$_bizcity_admin_ctx && !$_bizcity_twinchat_admin_shell_request`.
- `$_bizcity_twinchat_admin_shell_request` is true exactly when
  `?page=bizcity-twinchat` is open — i.e. the one page the operator was on.
- So the bootstrap never loaded, `admin_menu` never saw the registration, and
  the menu disappeared. The panel route itself was never involved.

**Fix:**

- New lightweight owner `core/twinbrain/includes/class-twinbrain-admin-menu.php`
  (`BizCity_TwinBrain_Admin_Menu`) owns *only* menu registration: parent
  `bizcity-twin-brain`, the six Control Panel deep-links, the Twin GPT entry and
  the legacy `bizcity-twinbrain` → TwinChat redirect. No REST, schema or
  provider behaviour.
- `bizcity-twin-ai.php` now loads that owner on **every** `is_admin()` request,
  outside the TwinChat shell gate. The heavy TwinBrain runtime stays behind the
  existing gate.
- `core/twinbrain/bootstrap.php` no longer registers any admin menu.
- `register()` is idempotent (`has_action()` guard) so a double load cannot
  duplicate the hook.

**Evidence:**

- New probe `core.admin_menu.twin_brain_owner` (Disk/Loader/Runtime, CLI-safe):
  `1 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip`, 7/7 steps. It asserts the bootstrap no longer owns
  the menu, the entrypoint loads the owner outside the shell gate, exactly one
  canonical parent registration exists, and `register()` is idempotent.
- Regression run with `core.crm.two_user_isolation` and
  `modules.twin_gpt.crm_inbox_positive_projection`: `3 pass · 0 fail`.
- Browser visibility on the deployed site remains a separate acceptance step.

### PHASE-TWINSHELL-NAV-GROUP — ActivityBar: non-must-load entries moved below QR - 2026-09-16

Requested: move the Pro/non-must-load plugin menus below the QR entry so every
plugin that is not part of the must-load contract sits in the lower group.

**Change** (`modules/twinshell/includes/default-plugins.php`):

- `section` changed `top` → `bottom` for the five plan-gated entries:
  `astro`, `doc`, `image`, `video`, `profile` (Portrait Studio).
- `qr` (QR Studio) moved to be the **last** entry of the `top` group, so it is
  the visible boundary between must-load and non-must-load entries.
- `creator` (Brain Factory) stays in `top`: it is not plan-gated, so it is out of
  scope for this rule.

Resulting top group (8): `twinchat`, `gateway`, `crm`, `web`, `creator`,
`personal`, `profile-public`, `qr`.
Resulting bottom group: `astro`, `doc`, `image`, `video`, `profile`, then the
existing utilities `marketplace`, `scheduler`, `workflow`, `skills`, `settings`.

**Evidence** (`core/diagnostics/includes/probes/class-probe-twinshell-boundary.php`):

- New Layer 3 step `ActivityBar grouping boundary` asserts (a) every entry with
  `has_plan_gate` is in the `bottom` section and (b) the last `top` entry is `qr`.
- Focused run: `php bin/diagnostics-run.php --filter=core.twinshell.boundary
  --skip-provision --skip-network --format=json` → `verdict=pass`,
  `counts={pass:1, fail:0, skip:0}`, step detail
  `plan-gated entries are bottom · top group ends with qr (top=8)`.
- `coverage.complete=false` — this is a focused single-probe run, not a
  full-batch/release PASS.

**Validation:** PHP 7.4.4 `php -l` PASS on `default-plugins.php` and the probe;
editor diagnostics PASS.

### PHASE-TWINSHELL-CHROME-HOTFIX2 — /twin/ redirect loop hardening (runtime still open) - 2026-09-16

Reported: `admin.php?page=bizcity-twinchat` renders fine, but opening `/twin/`
directly returns HTTP 500.

**Diagnosis (evidence-based):**

- `bps_php_error.log` (VPS canonical, 137 lines, window 08:23–08:29 UTC) contains
  **zero** `Fatal error` entries, so this is not a PHP crash.
- The Apache error page states `a 302 Found error was encountered while trying to
  use an ErrorDocument`, which is the signature of an internal redirect loop
  (`AH00124`) — Apache refuses further hops and emits a 500 for the *original*
  request. Under a passive `ErrorDocument` (no internal redirect) the browser
  would simply show "too many redirects" instead.
- `twin-shell.js::redirectLegacyAdminWrapper()` pulled the TOP window out of
  wp-admin and `adminWin.location.replace()`-d it back to `/twin/`, while
  `_doWriteShellUrl()` rebuilt the shell URL and dropped `bizcity_embed`. Paired
  with the guard added earlier the same day, that formed
  `/twin/` → `admin.php` → `/twin/` → …

**Changes:**

- `modules/twinshell/includes/class-twin-shell-page.php` — the operator
  hand-off to the wp-admin wrapper is now strictly one-way. It is skipped when
  the request is framed (`Sec-Fetch-Dest: iframe`), when `bizcity_admin_wrapper=1`
  is present, or when the referer is the wrapper itself. New
  `embedded_args()` helper mints `bizcity_embed=1` + `bizcity_admin_wrapper=1`
  for every shell URL the wrapper can reach, making a loop impossible by
  construction. Previously a one-flag check (`bizcity_embed`) was used, which the
  JS URL rewrite silently dropped.
- `modules/twinshell/assets/twin-shell.js` — `redirectLegacyAdminWrapper()`
  disabled (kept for reference); `_doWriteShellUrl()` preserves both markers
  across `replaceState`; the pop-out button and the "enter wp-admin" button carry
  the loop-breaker.
- `modules/twinchat/includes/class-twinchat-admin-menu.php` — the wrapper iframe
  now requests `bizcity_embed=1&bizcity_admin_wrapper=1`.

**Status: RUNTIME FAIL (open).** Source/build gates pass, but direct `/twin/`
still 500s on the target install. Remaining cause is outside these files and
needs VPS-side tracing (Apache error log + `Location:` headers from
`curl -I`). Not claimed as fixed.

**Validation:** PHP 7.4.4 `php -l` PASS (`class-twin-shell-page.php`,
`class-twinchat-admin-menu.php`); `node --check` PASS on `twin-shell.js`; BOM
check PASS; editor diagnostics PASS; VPS log read (no PHP fatal).

### PHASE-0.48D-USER-RAIL + PHASE-0-SETTING-PANEL-G6-HOTFIX2 — CRM rail grouped by WP user + Twin Brain menu fix - 2026-09-16

The management tier (`/twin/?plugin=crm`) manages Inbox per WordPress `user_id`
instead of per channel; each member logs in and uses the public frontend at
`/gpt/`. Also fixes a Twin Brain admin-menu regression.

**B2 per-user Inbox rail** (`plugins/bizcity-twin-crm`):

- New `GET /crm-settings/inbox-user-groups` (`class-rest-controller.php`,
  `get_crm_inbox_user_groups()`), `can_manage_rules()` only. Groups active
  inboxes by owner resolution order: `bizcity_zalo_accounts.owner_user_id` →
  `crm_inbox_id` (exact Personal owner), then `bizcity_crm_inbox_members`
  membership. Inboxes with no eligible owner are returned under `unassigned`.
  Only safe labels leave the server — no raw provider IDs, phones or tokens.
- `ChannelSidebar.jsx` gains a `Theo kênh` / `Theo người dùng` switch plus a
  per-user group header; selecting a user drives the existing server-authorized
  `scope_user_id` contract instead of a new authorization path.
- `InboxPanel.jsx` wires `onSelectUser` → `scopeUserId`, reusing the existing
  `crm-settings/user-inbox-scope` projection for `allowedInboxIds`.
- `crmApi.js` adds `getCrmInboxUserGroups` / `useGetCrmInboxUserGroupsQuery`.
- `styles.css` adds the grouping-switch and user-group-header styles.

Contract boundary preserved: C `/gpt/` stays current-user-only; this grouping is
a B2 `twin/?plugin=crm` surface and a posted user ID remains a selector input,
never an ACL. The all-channel view stays an explicit `Legacy` admin/diagnostic
mode.

**Twin Brain menu** (`core/twinbrain/bootstrap.php`):

- The new top-level parent slug was `bizcity-twinbrain`, which collided with the
  pre-existing `admin_init` compatibility redirect for that legacy page slug —
  clicking the new menu bounced straight to TwinChat. Parent slug is now
  `bizcity-twin-brain`; the legacy `bizcity-twinbrain` bookmark keeps redirecting.
- The parent page callback now routes to the Brain workspace destination instead
  of printing a dead notice.

**Validation:** PHP 7.4.4 `php -l` PASS on `class-rest-controller.php`,
`core/twinbrain/bootstrap.php`, `class-twin-shell-page.php`,
`class-twinchat-admin-menu.php`; editor diagnostics PASS on all changed files;
CRM Vite build PASS (`inbox-app.js` 2,910.24 kB / `inbox-app.css` 104.44 kB).
Browser/deployed Runtime evidence for the menu, the WP chrome and the per-user
rail remains pending until deploy.

### PHASE-0-SETTING-PANEL — VPS evidence runner + 3 probe defects found and fixed - 2026-09-16

Added `bin/setting-panel-vps-evidence.sh` — a one-command VPS MVP evidence
runner for the verified probe set, and fixed three defects it exposed.

**New runner** (`bin/setting-panel-vps-evidence.sh`):

- `--print` (preview every command), `--list` (verified inventory + real batch),
  `--only=<n>` (subset), `--out=<dir>`, `--provision`, `--network`.
- Passes `-d max_execution_time=0 -d memory_limit=512M`.
- Writes JSON + JUnit + stderr per step into `build/setting-panel-vps/<stamp>/`.
- Reads the envelope `counts` object instead of grepping `status`: a raw grep
  counts step-level statuses inside a probe that itself passed, which reported
  false non-pass counts for a PASSING probe.
- Detects an HTML error page (unmapped host → DB router fail-closed) and reports
  `verdict=NON_JSON` with the cause instead of `verdict=unknown`.
- `--host` is now optional-but-recommended rather than mandatory: probes run
  host-agnostically, and a host this install does not map makes the router fail
  closed. Both cases are labelled so the run is not overclaimed.
- `--only` runs report `RESULT=SUBSET_PASS` and state how many steps were
  excluded, so a partial run is never mistaken for full coverage.

**Defect 1 — `core.framework.extension_manifest` hard-coded catalog identity.**
The runtime assertion was `'1.8.0' === catalog_version && 24 === count(contracts)`.
The catalog legitimately moved to `1.9.0` with `26` contracts (including the
`setting-panel-registration` row), so the probe failed with
*"Manifest semantic policy or negative fixture expectation failed"* for an
unrelated reason and masked the semantic checks it exists to guard. Replaced
with a well-formed-semver check plus non-empty catalog and a resolved manifest
row, and the failure detail now prints every sub-flag so the next failure is
diagnosable from the probe output alone.

**Defect 2 — `core.membership.woo_projection` trips the 120s limit.** Measured
`121s` on a single-probe run, aborting the combined step with
`diagnostics_bootstrap_fatal` / *"Maximum execution time of 120 seconds
exceeded"* and destroying the evidence of the five fast probes beside it. The
code path calls `set_time_limit(120)` at runtime, which overrides
`-d max_execution_time=0`. It is now isolated as runner step 8 so one slow
probe cannot mask others. The root cause inside the membership/Woo projection
path is **not** fixed.

**Defect 3 — `core.channel.zalo_multi_account_isolation` fails functionally.**
`Exact Zalo account writes failed` / `At least one synthetic account row was not
accepted`, fix hint *"Register each exact Zalo channel contract and preserve
account.account_id at the writer boundary."* Pre-existing, outside Setting Panel
scope, recorded in the playbook so a Step 4 FAIL is not read as a panel or
registry regression.

Verification: bash `-n` PASS; runner executed end-to-end on the local install
(steps 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 → `SUBSET_PASS`, exit 0); extension-manifest probe now
`verdict=pass`; primary probe unchanged at `21/21 step pass · 14 registry
item(s) · 0 rejection(s) · resolve PASS · isolation PASS`; unit suite
`OK (47 tests, 246 assertions)`; contract runner `CONTRACT TESTS PASS (26
contracts)`.

Playbook updated with a "One-command runner" section, the Step 8 isolation
rationale, and the records for defects 2 and 3.

### PHASE-0-SETTING-PANEL — probe-registration regressions fixed, VPS evidence playbook - 2026-09-16

While building the VPS evidence plan, two registration regressions were found in
`core/diagnostics/bootstrap.php`. Both were silent — nothing errored, the
surfaces simply disappeared.

- **Setting Panel probe was not in the catalog.** The queue entry for
  `class-probe-setting-panel.php` was missing. The probe file self-registers
  through the `bizcity_diagnostics_register_probes` filter, but that filter only
  runs once the file is included, so with no queue entry the probe never loaded:
  catalog was `266` and `batch_for_probe('modules.twinshell.setting_panel')`
  resolved to `core` for an ID that did not exist (`exists=NO`). Every planned
  VPS command would have failed with *"No probes match filter"*. Queue entry
  restored; catalog is `267`, probe `exists=YES`.
- **`core.diagnostics.control_panel` registration was missing.** The
  diagnostics Setting Panel registration had been dropped, silently reducing the
  registry from **14 → 13 items** while the probe still reported `verdict=pass`.
  Restored with the guarded-function + `plugins_loaded`/`init` retry pattern
  documented in the Setting Panel author guide.
- Both files are untracked in git, so no history was available; the missing
  content was reconstructed from the contract schema and the documented
  registration pattern.

Verification after the fix: probe `21/21 step pass · 14 registry item(s) ·
0 rejection(s) · resolve PASS · isolation PASS`; PHP lint PASS; unit suite
`OK (47 tests, 246 assertions)`.

New document `modules/twinshell/docs/PHASE-0-SETTING-PANEL-VPS-EVIDENCE-PLAYBOOK.md`
is the owner for MVP runtime evidence collection:

- **25 probe IDs with verified batch membership** — `batch_for_probe()` was
  called for every ID against the live catalog, so the batch column is a real
  return value, not an inference. `modules.twinshell.setting_panel` is batch
  `core`. `core.framework.cli_verdict_parity` is `direct` (explicit-only,
  never aggregate coverage).
- Seven-step execution order: preconditions → focused probe → contract/route →
  CRM scope → `channel` batch → Master Plan read-only → `health` batch →
  wp-admin menu snapshot.
- PASS shape per layer, the full SKIP taxonomy (`skip`, `precondition_skip`,
  `network_skip`, `admin_required_skip`, `direct_only_skip`, `budget_deferred`
  are **not** PASS), the evidence record to capture, and a failure-triage table.
- An explicit table of which `M1`–`M15` criteria a probe run **cannot** prove:
  `M4` (role matrix), `M5` (second shard), `M9` (real plugin activation
  toggling) and `M13` (rollback drill) are manual by nature and must not be
  claimed from a probe verdict.

Wired into the checklist, phase plan and docs README.

### PHASE-0-SETTING-PANEL — two-phase packaging, MVP scope frozen - 2026-09-15

Split the phase into **Phase 1 (MVP)** and **Phase 2 (Commerce & Store)** and
froze the MVP boundary in a new owner document,
`modules/twinshell/docs/PHASE-0-SETTING-PANEL-MVP-PHASE-PLAN.md`.

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** one visible `Control Panel`, six destinations, the
  registration contract, server-side resolution, built-in owner adoption,
  Channel Settings zones, one canonical CRM Inbox, the Diagnostics deep-link and
  a **read-only** Master Plan exact-key projection. All Phase-1 **code** is
  complete; the remaining work is runtime/permission/tenant evidence plus the
  release process.
- **Phase 2 (deferred):** Plugins Store install/activate/update lifecycle, B1
  Master Plan manage/compare/purchase/upgrade/renew/history, and retirement of
  the legacy top-level menus. Deferred because they depend on decisions that do
  not exist yet (lifecycle API ownership, B1 `master/config.actions`) or on
  Phase-1 runtime proof.
- The plan assigns **every** unfinished checklist item to a phase (Phase 1: 40
  evidence/release items · Phase 2: 13 deferred items), defines MVP exit criteria
  `M1`–`M15`, and records the seven residual risks MVP accepts (empty
  translation catalog, registry-level-only availability, idle legacy bridge,
  legacy roots still materializing, no network-admin entry, empty
  `plugins-store`, runtime evidence absent).
- `SKIP`, `deferred` and `blocked` are explicitly not PASS; MVP is declared
  shipped only when `M1`–`M15` all pass.
- Canon, roadmap, docs README and the implementation checklist now link the phase
  plan and carry the matching status line; the checklist gains a Phase Plan
  section that states which item belongs to which phase and why.
- No runtime code changed in this pass. Latest code evidence still stands: probe
  `21/21 step pass · 14 registry item(s) · 0 rejection(s) · resolve PASS ·
  isolation PASS`; unit suite `OK (47 tests, 246 assertions)`; contract runner
  `CONTRACT TESTS PASS (26 contracts)`.

### PHASE-0-SETTING-PANEL G3-05 — server-side resolution for labels, URLs and availability - 2026-09-15

Closed `G3-05` (translation/URL resolution) and completed the failure matrix in
`G8-10`; advanced `G8-09`.

- `BizCity_Setting_Panel_Registry::resolve()` / `resolved_all()` now return a
  render-ready row per admitted item: `label`/`description` through `__()` with
  a deterministic fallback from the last key segment, `url` per renderer type
  (`route` → relative route, `deep_link` → `admin_url('admin.php?page=…')`,
  `external` → `esc_url_raw` of a validated https target), and
  `availability_state`. Resolution stays metadata-only: no option read,
  renderer load, provider call or schema work.
- `BizCity_Twin_Shell_REST::list_setting_panel()` returns the resolved rows, and
  `SettingPanel.jsx` consumes `item.label`/`item.description`/`item.url` instead
  of deriving labels client-side (`registryLabel()` is now a fallback only).
- New `resolve_availability()` evaluates `availability.policy`,
  `dependency_ids` and `min_framework`/`min_php`/`min_wp` floors into
  `available` / `unavailable` / `incompatible` / `update_required`. This is the
  mechanism behind `G8-09` and the "unavailable renderer" half of `G8-10`.
- **Dependency-detection defect found and fixed:** the first implementation
  resolved `plugins.x` by probing an exact `/slug/slug.php` path and core
  packages by a class-name map. Both were wrong — `bizcity-profile` ships
  `bizcity-personal.php`, and core packages publish varying class names — so
  **4 of 14** real surfaces were reported `unavailable`. Detection now matches
  the declared owner directory (`/core/<x>/`, `/modules/<x>/`, `/plugins/<x>/`)
  against the request include list plus the WordPress activation list, and all
  14 registrations resolve `available`.
- Probe gained a fourth layer (`resolve.*`: `resolve.api`, `resolve.labels`,
  `resolve.urls`, `resolve.availability`, `resolve.read_only`); the run summary
  now reports each layer separately.

Evidence: probe `21/21 step pass · 14 registry item(s) · 0 rejection(s) ·
resolve PASS · isolation PASS` with `Every one of 14 item(s) resolved a non-empty
label`, `Every item resolved a safe target URL across 14 renderer(s)`,
`Availability resolved for every item (available=14)` (`blog_id=1533`,
PHP 8.1.34, WP 6.9); unit suite `OK (47 tests, 246 assertions)` with 4 new
resolver tests; `CONTRACT TESTS PASS (26 contracts)`; `npx eslint` exit 0;
`npm run build` PASS. Remaining: the `.po`/`.mo` catalog for the registration
`label_key` values is still empty, so the fallback label renders today; `G8-09`
still lacks a live plugin-activation matrix.

### PHASE-0-SETTING-PANEL G7 — author guide, isolation proof and PHPUnit false-green fix - 2026-09-15

Closed `G7-02` (extension authoring path) and `G7-07` (registration isolation)
in `modules/twinshell/docs/PHASE-0-SETTING-PANEL-IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md`.

- `docs/contracts/SETTING-PANEL-REGISTRATION-CONTRACT-v1.md` §2.1 is now the
  canonical author guide: SDK registration sample, load-order survival pattern
  with an explicit warning against `is_admin()` guards, destination/zone table,
  enforced rules, verification command and an 8-row reference implementations
  table. `README.md` documents the `setting_panel` verb and its caveats.
- `examples/bizcity-reference-plugin` is now a working fixture for both paths:
  `manifest.json` declares `extension.reference.settings` and
  `bizcity-reference-plugin.php` registers the same metadata at runtime through
  `BizCity_Twin_Plugin_SDK::register_ui()` with `plugins_loaded`/`init` retry.
- Probe `modules.twinshell.setting_panel` gained a fourth layer (`isolation.*`):
  15 malformed fixtures must be rejected before admission with a recorded reason,
  the admitted owner set must stay identical, and the registry must roll back to
  its pre-isolation snapshot. Added diagnostics-only
  `BizCity_Setting_Panel_Registry::diagnostics_snapshot()` /
  `diagnostics_restore()` for that rollback; `diagnostics_restore()` ignores
  malformed state so a bad argument cannot clear the registry.
- `G3-04` enum enforcement closed. `BizCity_Setting_Panel_Registry::normalize()`
  previously checked only presence for `renderer`/`availability`; it now rejects
  invalid `renderer.type`, `renderer.id`, `availability.policy`, `capability`,
  `zone`, renderer shape violations (`coreui`/`route` without `route`,
  `deep_link` without `canonical_slug`, malformed `route`), and
  `legacy_adapter` entries missing `native_contract`/`migration_owner`/
  `sunset_after` — matching the v1 schema. Verified against the real registry:
  14 items still register with `0 rejection(s)`.
- **Test-harness defect fixed:** `composer test` was exiting with code 0 and no
  output at all. `composer.json` autoloads
  `core/bizcity-llm/includes/helpers-deprecation.php` under `autoload.files`, and
  PHPUnit's launcher requires the Composer autoloader before `tests/bootstrap.php`,
  so that helper's `defined( 'ABSPATH' ) || exit;` killed the process before any
  test loaded. Added `tests/phpunit-prepend.php` and changed the `test` script to
  `php -d auto_prepend_file=tests/phpunit-prepend.php vendor/bin/phpunit ...`.
  CI calls `composer test`, so it inherits the fix. Any earlier PHPUnit PASS
  claim made without this preload was a silent no-op.

Evidence: probe `16/16 step pass · 14 registry item(s) · 0 rejection(s) ·
isolation PASS` (`blog_id=1533`, PHP 8.1.34, WP 6.9); `SettingPanelRegistryTest`
6/6 PASS (36 assertions); full unit suite `OK (43 tests, 199 assertions)`;
`node core/twin-core/contracts/tests/run-contract-tests.mjs` →
`CONTRACT TESTS PASS (26 contracts)`; PHP lint PASS on every changed file.
Runtime menu/tenant evidence and the reference fixture's local activation remain
open.

### PHASE-0.41-C10/W7-C Diagnostics - 2026-09-10

Added a fail-open boundary around Scheduler Google create/update/delete hooks
so a Google sync exception cannot invalidate a committed local Scheduler event.
Registered `modules.twin_gpt.crm_google_independent_cron`, whose focused local
probe passes on PHP 7.4.4 with `1 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip` and no provider or
Scheduler/CRM fixture side effect. Added a diagnostic-only member-scoped
fixture fallback for `modules.twin_gpt.crm_care_scope`, using canonical CRM
Repository/Team Manager owners and cleanup through the marked diagnostic inbox
boundary. Its focused local run now passes on PHP 7.4.4, blog `1532`, with
`1 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip`. Added the canonical bounded mutation store to care
note/task/event/label writes, fixed nested note JSON forwarding and verified a
same-key note retry returns the stored response without a duplicate CRM note.
The successful local run required `-d max_execution_time=0` because the
diagnostics/WooCommerce bootstrap exceeds the default 120-second CLI limit;
it also emitted an existing `bizcity_crm_working_hours` auto-create warning.
A/B denial, Scheduler event replay, disconnected reminder/cron, provider
delivery and browser evidence remain open.

### PHASE-0.41-W8.1 Order draft read path - 2026-09-13

Added the first W8 slice as a read-only exact-conversation product search:
TwinWeb revalidates the current C Inbox/contact scope, delegates to the
canonical `BizCity_CRM_Order_Adapter_Registry`, and returns an explicit
`draft_only` policy with `creates_order=false`, `payment=false` and
`shipping=false`. No Woo order, payment or shipping side effect is performed.
The C action catalog exposes `order_draft` only when the adapter is available
and the current user has write capability. PHP 7.4.4 lint and the TwinWeb
build pass. The registered W8.1 probe is lint-clean but its local Runtime run
was deferred by existing CRM schema auto-create drift and the diagnostics/
`wpdb` 120-second execution limit before a result could be returned; product
fixture/UI/runtime evidence remains pending.

W8.2 now exposes exact-scope, redacted payment options through the same
canonical Order Adapter. Full payment link/QR issuance remains blocked behind
confirmation/idempotency and provider-owner evidence; full bank account values
are not returned and no payment ledger is created by this read path.

W8.4 now has a generic `BizCity_Twin_Action_Confirmation` boundary loaded by
Twin Core. The prepare-only C order confirmation route binds blog/user/action/
resource/request hash, and one-time consume rejects replay and foreign users.
Focused `modules.twin_gpt.crm_order_confirmation` Runtime passed on blog `1533`;
order/payment/shipping mutations remain disabled until the remaining W8 gates.

W8.3 now has a provider-neutral `BizCity_CRM_Fulfillment_Adapter_Interface` and
registry with `quote/create/track/eta` capability boundaries. The registry has
no built-in provider and fails closed until a verified fulfillment adapter is
registered; the existing Woo tracking reader remains read-only compatibility
input. PHP 7.4.4 lint passes, and focused
`modules.twin_gpt.employee_fulfillment` Runtime passed on blog `1533` with
`1 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip`; the selected probe was complete but the overall
catalog remained incomplete (`1/264`). Provider adapter and real fulfillment
Runtime evidence remain pending.

W8.5 reuses the existing Scheduler target resolver precedence for the future
post-mutation notification boundary: an explicitly resolved target wins, with
`metadata.inbound` as the canonical fallback. W8.6 now has the
metadata-only `BizCity_Twin_Action_Evidence` envelope, which preserves action
correlation and before/after state hashes without storing protected payloads.
Focused `modules.twin_gpt.employee_action_evidence` Runtime passed on blog
`1533` with `1 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip`; the selected probe was complete while
the overall catalog remained incomplete (`1/265`). Mutation producer, order
lifecycle worker/reconcile, provider notification and W8.7 disposable Woo
evidence remain pending.

W8.7 remains explicitly blocked after tracing the active mutation owners. The
only existing Woo create route is the legacy CRM
`BizCity_CRM_REST_Controller::post_conversation_order()` path, which invokes
the side-effecting adapter without the C confirmation consume, durable
idempotency, before/after evidence, order-lifecycle event or exact-channel
notification boundary required by W8. The C surface remains read/draft/
prepare-only; no second create route was added.

Registered `modules.twin_gpt.employee_order_mutation_gate` to make that
rollback boundary executable. Its scoped local Runtime passed on PHP `7.4.4`,
blog `1533`, with `1 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip`: TwinWeb's prepare-only
confirmation route is present and the C `order-create` route is absent. The
selected probe was complete, but the overall catalog remained incomplete
(`1/266`); this is fail-closed evidence, not order-creation evidence.

### PHASE-0.48C Composer and mutation contract - 2026-09-12

Completed the source/build contract for the next C CRM slice. Attachment
capability is now server-driven: only writable Zalo Personal Inbox scope exposes
the attachment action, while MIME and size policy are returned by the server and
unsupported channels stay read-only. The TwinWeb composer consumes that policy.

Contact facts now use the bounded mutation store with caller-owned idempotency
keys, replay/conflict/pending handling and Enter-to-save IME protection. Zalo
Personal outbound text/attachment sends claim the same mutation store before
CRM/provider work, preserve the key across retry and normalize the canonical CRM
response envelope for the C client.

PHP 7.4.4 lint, editor diagnostics and TwinWeb Vite build pass. Runtime
attachment ownership/MIME/provider delivery, contact-facts replay, outbound
replay and browser evidence remain deferred to the probe pass.

Added the CX2 C-safe group-roster wrapper. It revalidates the exact current-user
conversation scope, delegates provider retrieval to the canonical CRM/ZCA owner,
and returns only HMAC member references plus bounded display/avatar fields. Raw
provider UIDs and group identity are not exposed to the browser. PHP lint, editor
diagnostics and TwinWeb build pass; provider freshness and Runtime roster evidence
remain deferred.

The `/gpt/crm/` context rail now consumes that server-authorized roster only when
`group_roster` capability is present, clears loading state on degraded/error
responses, and keeps group members separate from personal profile enrichment.

Added the C add-customer wrapper and context-rail form. The server derives the
authorized CRM Inbox from the current `channel/ref` scope, rejects browser
owner/inbox ACL inputs, creates the contact through `BizCity_CRM_Repository`,
and uses the bounded mutation store for replay safety. Friend request and group
invite remain provider-contract gaps. PHP lint, editor diagnostics and TwinWeb
build pass; Runtime contact-creation evidence remains deferred.

### PHASE-0.41-W7-C VPS focused evidence - 2026-09-12

Operator-run mapped-host batch on `libedemo.bizcity.vn`, blog `1511`, PHP
`7.4.33` returned `6 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip` for exact Inbox lookup, B2/C
scope, Twin GPT console denial, care A/B isolation and idempotency, Scheduler
correlation/reminder dedupe, and attachment upload/delete ownership.

The result is a filtered batch with `coverage.complete=false`, and nested SKIPs
remain for missing multi-account/Context Bank/foreign-Personal/positive-account
fixtures. The supplied output did not include the canonical VPS PHP error-log
tail, so production log correlation, provider outbound delivery and browser
evidence remain open.

### PHASE-0.48C Runtime closure plan - 2026-09-12

Added the single W7-C/0.48C closure plan and checklist for the remaining
multi-account/OA fixtures, Context Bank receipt admission, foreign Personal
canary, positive assigned-account projection, attachment provider delivery,
contact-facts replay, outbound replay, group-roster freshness and add-customer
Runtime evidence. Each gate now names its owner, disposable fixture,
acceptance evidence, cleanup/rollback boundary and planned probe ID.

The planned probe IDs are explicitly marked not registered and cannot be treated
as Runtime PASS until they enter the canonical Diagnostics catalog and fixed
batch. The plan also requires canonical VPS PHP error-log correlation and a
complete aggregate (`coverage.complete=true`, `deferred=0`, `fail=0`) before
W7-C/C-13/C-14 can be release-ready.
Registered and locally passed the combined
`modules.twin_gpt.crm_contact_mutation_replay` probe for RC-6/RC-9. The
disposable fixture proved contact-facts `success -> replay -> conflict` and
add-customer `success -> replay -> foreign denial` on blog `1533`. VPS rerun,
contact audit correlation and production evidence remain pending; existing
auto-create warnings for `working_hours` and `conversation_labels` remain
separate infrastructure debt.

### PHASE-0.41-W7-C Scheduler correlation - 2026-09-11

Registered `modules.twin_gpt.crm_scheduler_correlation` and added a disposable
fixture probe for the canonical CRM Scheduler adapter. Local PHP 7.4.4 Runtime
passed on blog `1533`: Scheduler metadata retained source/contact/conversation/
inbound correlation, the due reminder was claimed exactly once, and repeated
reminder handling produced one canonical CRM system note through the existing
`external_source_id` dedupe path. Google provider and production cron evidence
remain separate pending gates.

### PHASE-0.48C Customer-scoped care tools contract - 2026-09-10

Implemented the C CRM contact-care slice around server-resolved `contact_id`: the care
route/repository projection reads private notes, contact-related tasks,
scheduled events and assigned CRM labels only within the authorized Inbox
scope. The UI now provides a `Ghi chú / Đặt lịch` composer, contact-specific
lists, Enter-to-save fact fields with IME guards, and a `Gán nhãn` picker using
the CRM admin label catalog. No new table was added. User-owned labels remain
blocked until owner/visibility, collision/deletion and R-DCL/Schema Registry/
Site Provisioner review are approved. PHP lint, editor diagnostics and TwinWeb
build pass; authenticated Runtime evidence remains pending.

The Scheduler event form now creates contact-linked appointments through
`BizCity_CRM_Scheduler_Adapter`, and `/gpt/myaccount/` includes current-user CRM
tasks and Scheduler events in Work history. The CRM composer reuses the existing
owner-scoped Media upload contract for one attachment per outbound message and
supports Enter-to-send with Shift+Enter newline plus IME protection. These are
source/build/lint results only; Scheduler reminder, Google-disconnected cron,
provider attachment delivery, cache/idempotency and authenticated browser
evidence remain open.
### PHASE-0.41 W5.4/W5.5 framework gates - 2026-09-09

Mapped the existing loader gates to W5.4 and the existing framework security
probes to W5.5. Extended `core.framework.production_contract` with a runtime
public-manifest fixture that rejects secret, token, password and owner-ID
exposure. The fixture caught a real nested-channel allowlist gap in
`BizCity_Framework_Handle::public_manifest()`, which is now fixed. PHP 7.4.4
lint, editor diagnostics and a dependency-free nested redaction smoke pass.
Ordinary-frontend memory measurement and focused diagnostics execution remain
deferred because the local WordPress diagnostics bootstrap times out before
returning JSON.

### PHASE-0.48 CRM connection and responsive workspace UX - 2026-09-09

My Channels now displays owner-scoped Zalo Personal bridge/session readiness on
the main Connection surface, including expired-session recovery, instead of
hiding the state inside the connection modal. Connection actions now use
`Quản lý kết nối`. CRM shows an immediate expiry banner, changes refresh to
`Hết phiên · Đăng nhập lại` when the exact account is not ready, and persists
desktop conversation/tools column collapse state across F5. Tablet uses a
two-column workspace and mobile retains the list/thread/context-sheet flow.
TwinWeb build and editor diagnostics pass; production browser verification
still requires deployment of the new bundle and PHP artifacts.

The `Hết phiên · Đăng nhập lại` action now opens the connection manager directly
on Zalo Cá nhân and automatically starts QR reset for the current account,
instead of opening the generic all-channel view. The retry guard resets when
the manager closes so a failed QR attempt can be retried.

Aligned the expired-session branch with Core Channel Gateway: `startQR` is used
for `expired`, `logged_out` and `revoked`; `resetQR` is reserved for an active
`connected` session. Structured QR error fields are now shown when the bridge
returns them instead of collapsing the failure to `HTTP 500`.

After QR status becomes `connected`, TwinWeb now refetches account/status, CRM
Inbox and member projections before reloading the C surface. Core Channel
Gateway now refetches account and bridge health before reloading its admin
surface. This rehydrates messages already accepted through the sidecar callback
and CRM owner; it does not claim historical provider import.

### PHASE-0.41/0.48 - Zalo readiness and C CRM contact facts - 2026-09-09

Live browser checkpoint remains deployment-blocked: `/gpt/crm/` serves the
previous Twin GPT bundle (`index-BOavQmYN.js`), and the new same-origin contact
route returns `404 rest_no_route`. No production PASS is claimed until the
current PHP and Vite artifacts are deployed together and the authenticated
status/contact probes are rerun.

Added an owner-scoped Zalo Personal readiness projection to the existing QR
status route. Account mapping, bridge health, session status, queue status and
callback freshness are now separate fields; missing sidecar evidence remains
`unknown`/degraded instead of being inferred from local `connected` state. QR
recovery continues to preserve the account and CRM mapping.

Added a C exact-conversation contact-facts wrapper for editable phone/email. It
revalidates identity and Inbox scope, uses the canonical Vietnamese phone
normalizer, rejects conflicts, and delegates mutation to the existing CRM
contact owner. Source/build and editor diagnostics pass; authenticated Runtime,
worker and provider evidence remain pending.

Order draft creation remains blocked because the current Woo adapter exposes
only `create_order()` and immediately creates a real pending order; no
draft-only canonical owner exists yet. The C capability catalog therefore
returns `order_draft=false` and keeps `Tạo đơn hàng` disabled. Customer 360
timeline/insight remains read-only and evidence-backed.

### PHASE-0.39H CRM focus-area collapse - 2026-09-05

Collapsed the left-rail `Công cụ` section and the conversation-list filter
stack by default. Search and conversation rows stay visible; status, labels,
priority, assignee and thread-type controls expand on demand. This preserves
filter state while giving the message and care workspace more room.

### PHASE-0.39H Inbox action hierarchy - 2026-09-05

Moved Inbox `Công cụ`, conversation search, `Bộ lọc` and `Bảng` actions into
the TopBar beside notifications; search opens only on icon or `Ctrl+F`.
Moved the sidebar collapse arrow beside the brand and narrowed the conversation
list column to prioritize the message and order surfaces.

Also fixed the production `CAN_MANAGE_INBOXES is not defined` runtime crash by
restoring the boot-configured capability guard, and synchronized iframe CRM
tab/deep-link hashes into the outer Twin shell `_url` so refresh preserves the
active menu and Inbox route.

### Context Bank channel-user ownership contract - 2026-09-04

Added PHASE-1.33A as the canonical extension for one fixed primary user per
channel account, bounded delegated users, `/gpt/` current-user self-binding and
SQL-index-to-filestore authorization. The MVP grant store reuses exact-key
WordPress user meta with tenant/channel/HMAC account identity and creates no new
ACL table; credentials, phone numbers, provider/customer IDs and payloads are
forbidden. User meta remains approved only for bounded low-churn grants and must
migrate to CRM inbox/team membership or an R-DCL table when atomic, high-volume
or multidimensional membership queries are required. PHASE-1.33 master now
requires the 1.33A U1/U2/admin grant matrix before channel-owned Context Bank
evidence is exposed to member UI.

### PHASE-0.39H group participants fallback - 2026-09-04

Added a group-only `Members` tab in the CRM Inbox. It derives a latest-first
list of unique recently seen senders from existing message metadata and labels
the limitation clearly; it does not claim a complete provider roster, create
schema, add a REST route or call a private Zalo API. Full group-member listing
and native mention delivery remain gated on a confirmed public `zca-js@2.1.2`
capability.

### PHASE-0.39H ActivityFeed contrast follow-up - 2026-09-04

Darkened the remaining low-contrast ActivityFeed metadata and inactive status
color used by the Inbox Information surface. The change is presentation-only;
activity creation, REST behavior and status semantics are unchanged.

### PHASE-0.39H Information tab naming - 2026-09-04

Renamed the visible CRM right-rail `Contact` tab and heading to `Information`
to match the requested `Members / Information / Orders` workflow. Internal
state names and API contracts remain unchanged.

### PHASE-0.39H group tab order - 2026-09-05

Ordered the group right-rail tabs as `Members / Information / Đặt đơn`, while
keeping non-group conversations on the existing `Information / Đặt đơn` flow.

### PHASE-0.39H CRM wrap scope - 2026-09-05

Expanded the `.wrap` reset from the Inbox top-level body class to the
registered CRM submenu body classes only. Generic WordPress admin screens are
not affected; the screenshot's unrelated page remains unresolved without its
exact URL/menu identity.

### PHASE-0.39H provider roster and native mentions - 2026-09-05

Implemented the public `zca-js@2.1.2` group roster path
(`getGroupInfo` -> `memVerList` -> `getGroupMembersInfo`) and native group
mentions through `MessageContent.mentions[]`. CRM validates mention UIDs against
the server-side roster before dispatch. Local bridge build and focused adapter,
route and session tests pass `29/29`; VPS/provider delivery evidence remains
deferred.

Bridge runtime version bumped to `0.39.7` so the VPS source-to-image check can
distinguish the roster/mention implementation from the previous `0.39.6`
runtime.

### PHASE-0.39H Inbox readability pass - 2026-09-04

Applied a scoped contrast pass to the CRM Inbox `ContactDrawer`,
`ConversationDetail` and `ConversationList` surfaces. Small labels, metadata,
filters and empty states now use readable slate tones; status, warning and
outbound message colors remain semantic. The frontend production build passed
with 2872 modules transformed. No schema, REST or provider behavior changed.

### CRM-PATH-4 synthetic matcher isolation - 2026-09-04

The canonical automation matcher now preserves `_test` and `_dry_run` flags
when normalizing inbound payloads. CRM-PATH diagnostics can therefore verify
ZALO_OA and ZALO_PERSONAL `run_source=crm_care` routing without emitting a
user-facing matcher ACK or provider/channel send. The focused
`core.automation.crm_path` probe passed on local blog `1526`; live inbound,
member ownership and production activation remain separate gates.

### Legacy disposal decision status - 2026-09-04

Diagnostics now displays `DISPOSAL DECISION DONE — no legacy data retention`
for the operator-approved dead projection set, separately from the physical
row count and the policy-controlled `ready_to_drop`/`dropped` states. Existing
rows remain protected until the applicable owner scope, zero-row and cleanup
gates are completed; this status does not authorize a bulk delete or DROP.

### Session-state scoreboard scope - 2026-09-04

The contract scoreboard now treats `modules.webchat.session_state` as an
encrypted session metadata filestore with `Context Bank` scope
`not_applicable`. Memory filestore contracts still require registered Context
Bank adapter and ledger evidence. This removes the false incomplete warning
for `bizcity_webchat_sessions` without changing any cleanup or DROP gate.

### VPS legacy batch follow-up - 2026-09-04

The fresh target-VPS `legacy` batch after the WebChat owner/tool deployment fix
was resumed to completion under run
`diag_20260904132824_6e0be0af`. The aggregate result is `22 pass · 0 fail · 1
precondition skip`, with `coverage.complete=true` and `deferred=0`; the
overall `warn` is the expected Hub-only client billing boundary plus the
contract scoreboard's stale historical evidence for
`bizcity_zalo_bot_memory` and `bizcity_llm_usage`. Owner parity, WebChat
tool-registry parity and CRUD-stop passed with zero mutation SQL in the
request-local observation window. `bizcity_webchat_sessions` scores complete
with Context Bank scope `not_applicable`. No production table was deleted or
dropped; approved-drop evidence was limited to the disposable fixture.

### Legacy owner evidence refresh pending - 2026-09-04

The complete legacy batch is closed at the batch-coverage level, but its
contract scoreboard still reports stale persisted evidence for
`bizcity_zalo_bot_memory` and `bizcity_llm_usage`. The next controlled step is
to run both owner probes freshly on target blog `1511`, then rerun the
scoreboard in the same deployed context. This is an evidence refresh only and
does not authorize approval, `ready_to_drop`, DELETE or DROP.

### Legacy owner evidence refresh PASS - 2026-09-05

Target blog `1511` executed both focused owner probes with PHP `7.4.33`:
`modules.zalobot.memory_unify` and
`core.bizcity_llm.usage_filestore_parity` returned `2 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip`.
The JUnit artifact is `build/legacy-owner-refresh-20260905.xml`, with catalog
hash `19ef8457fdaea0b803183f14d378020eee6c55b0055f94ea67870f04ce0f9646` and
batch hash `23d42e332f374f0cdfc0e8844121eb74ca2de7209b0bbbf7608880aee4252dfe`.
The contract scoreboard still needs a separate rerun after these persisted
owner results. Canonical-log BPS fatals and unrelated multisite backup-scan
errors remain operational findings, not owner-probe failures.

### Legacy scoreboard refresh warning - 2026-09-05

The target scoreboard rerun on blog `1511` executed successfully with no fail,
skip or defer, but returned `4960/5000` (`48/50` rows complete). The fresh
Zalo memory and client LLM usage rows are now complete. The two remaining stale
owner rows are `bizcity_cg_flows` (`channel-gateway.flows`) and
`bizcity_twin_context_logs` (`twinbrain.goal_contracts`). Their owner artifacts
exist but need fresh runtime evidence before the scoreboard can reach
`5000/5000`; this does not authorize cleanup or DROP.

### Legacy flow and Goal Contract owner refresh PASS - 2026-09-05

The target owner refresh on blog `1511` returned `2 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip`.
`channel-gateway.flows` confirmed canonical `wp_1511_bizcity_crm_flows`, CRUD
and codec round-trip, REST registration and removal of interim
`wp_1511_bizcity_cg_flows`. `twinbrain.goal_contracts` confirmed the physical
projection schema, registry/provisioner wiring and tenant-scoped read. Its
production live-write fixture remained intentionally skipped for sandbox-only
execution. JUnit: `build/legacy-owner-refresh-flows-goals-20260905.xml`.
The scoreboard must be rerun after these owner results; no cleanup or DROP is
authorized by this focused PASS.

### Legacy contract scoreboard PASS - 2026-09-05

After all four stale owner rows were refreshed, the target scoreboard on blog
`1511` returned `5000/5000` points, `50/50` catalog rows complete,
`incomplete_rows=[]`, `1 pass · 0 warn · 0 fail · 0 skip`, and `verdict=pass`.
JUnit: `build/legacy-scoreboard-refresh-final-20260905.xml`. This closes the
contract-score readiness slice only; the complete legacy aggregate,
multi-request zero-growth, G1-G5, owner approval, zero-row and production DROP
gates remain separate and pending.

### Final aggregate legacy batch pending - 2026-09-05

The final focused contract scoreboard is PASS at `5000/5000` and `50/50`,
but a fresh aggregate `legacy` batch is still required after the last flow and
Goal Contract owner refreshes if a current release artifact is needed. The
aggregate must be run with a new run ID and read from complete JSON coverage;
the previous checkpoint must not be resumed. No cleanup or DROP is authorized
by the focused scoreboard.

### Legacy memory and WebChat storage consolidation - 2026-09-03

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Memory family ownership | User, episodic, rolling, session and notes payloads now use their canonical encrypted business filestore/Context Bank owners; legacy SQL readers are fail-closed and legacy schema installers are no longer registered for WebChat, episodic or rolling projections. | Focused local diagnostics PASS: 5/5 probes, including Context Bank references/tombstones and all memory filestore owners; production zero-growth and cleanup evidence remain pending |
| Notes ownership | WebChat workflow, AJAX and KG notebook pinned-note readers use `BizCity_TwinChat_Notes_Service`; `bizcity_twinchat_notes` is catalogued as a deprecated alias of `modules.twinchat.memory_notes`. | Focused `core.memory.notes_filestore_parity` PASS; source/loader/runtime validation complete for this slice |
| WebChat conversation consolidation | `bizcity_webchat_conversations` is quarantined and its active runtime callers now use message-owned identity/list/count/status/title compatibility views over `bizcity_webchat_messages`. | Local `core.webchat.conversation_message_unify` PASS; physical zero-growth, zero-row, owner approval and cleanup gates remain pending |
| WebChat session-state consolidation | `bizcity_webchat_sessions` no longer receives active runtime SQL DDL/CRUD; session metadata/state is owned by encrypted `modules.webchat.session_state`, while `BizCity_Session_Memory_Spec` uses `modules.webchat.session_memory_spec`. | Local WebChat owner probes 4/4 PASS and three independent session-state requests PASS; VPS probes, full legacy batch and production cleanup evidence remain pending |
| PHASE-1.30 validation update | Active caller sweep reports `ACTIVE_SQL_HITS=0`; focused WebChat owner, caller and lifecycle safety probes pass. | Full local legacy batch remains budget-deferred (`run_id=diag_20260903153504_2ca0e5e3`); G1 HTTP and G4 physical-shard checks remain skipped/deferred until target evidence exists |

### Context Bank REST and reconciliation hardening - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| REST ownership boundary | Context Bank list reads now pass only server-authorized tenant/owner filters into the bounded Search owner; list rows use the same metadata-only public projection as single-record reads. | PHP 7.4.4 lint and editor diagnostics PASS; live HTTP permission matrix remains pending behind the mapped runtime bootstrap blocker |
| Reconcile observability | Added bounded `R-CRON-META` start, failure-reason and completion events to the file-to-ledger reconciler without advancing checkpoints on failure or creating a cron schedule. | PHP 7.4.4 lint and editor diagnostics PASS; failure injection, concurrent append and production aggregate evidence remain pending |
| Reconcile checkpoint safety | Refuse a regressed source cursor, confirm checkpoint persistence before reporting advancement, and emit bounded `reconcile_checkpoint_advanced` or `reconcile_checkpoint_persist_failed` events. Added the focused reconciler probe. | `core.context_bank.reconciler` PASS 6/6 on blog 1526 with PHP 7.4.4; injected file/SQL failure, retention and complete aggregate evidence remain pending |
| Reconcile exception safety | Reader, ledger-admission and checkpoint-option exceptions now become bounded failed batches; the prior checkpoint is returned and no cursor advancement is reported. | Focused `core.context_bank.reconciler` PASS 6/6 on blog 1526 with PHP 7.4.4; real failure injection and production aggregate evidence remain pending |
| REST exception safety | Context Bank REST search, ledger dependency and pointer-follow exceptions now return the canonical four-field error envelope instead of escaping as a fatal. Added focused REST boundary probe coverage. | Focused `core.context_bank.rest` PASS 7/7 on blog 1526 with PHP 7.4.4, including unauthenticated/admin/valid-owner/modified-owner branches and disposable-user cleanup; mapped-domain and browser/UI evidence remain pending |
| KG citation and deferred retry | Added bounded KG passage -> xref -> Context Bank pointer -> canonical owner citation resolution, KG-Hub extraction ownership enforcement, and pending candidate retry scheduling with Diagnostics CLI isolation. | Focused `core.context_bank.kg_bridge` PASS 15/15 on blog 1526 with PHP 7.4.4; promoted KG notebook/vector, stale/rebuild and unavailable-KG runtime fixtures remain pending |
| Mapped REST probe | Exact unauthenticated request to `https://libedemo.bizcity.vn/wp-json/bizcity-context/v1/records?limit=1` returned HTTP 401 with `code/message` only; deployed artifact parity is not yet proven for the new four-field handler response. | Observed HTTP response only; no VPS PHP/log conclusion. Redeploy current REST controller and rerun authenticated plus unauthenticated mapped matrix |
| KG retry bound | KG-unavailable promotion now keeps the verified Context Bank pointer pending and caps tenant-bound rechecks at three attempts, emitting `kg_recheck_exhausted` instead of allowing an unbounded retry loop. | Focused `core.context_bank.kg_bridge` PASS 15/15 on blog 1526 with PHP 7.4.4; promoted KG runtime and unavailable-KG injection remain pending |
| Full diagnostics blocker | `--skip-provision --isolated-mu` still reaches `diagnostics_bootstrap_fatal` in the active Object Cache Pro/DB routing path before G4 probe execution. | Infrastructure blocker outside Context Bank; no full aggregate or production PASS claimed |
| Mapped VPS Context Bank core probes | The deployed mapped tenant executed the current KG bridge and REST owner-matrix probes through the canonical `core` batch with the resolved VPS PHP binary. | `PHP_BIN=/usr/local/bin/php`, PHP `7.4.33`, WordPress `6.9`, blog `1511`, `libedemo.bizcity.vn`; `2 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip`, `641ms`; KG `15/15` and REST `7/7` steps passed. Filtered `coverage.complete=false`; physical KG promotion/citation, external HTTP parity and Skills UI evidence remain pending |
| Skills Context Bank read-through UI | Added a feature-flagged Context Bank panel to the existing Skills SPA. It reads only same-origin `bizcity-context/v1/records` with the WP nonce, renders bounded metadata and provides loading/empty/denied/degraded/error/cursor states without exposing payload or pointer fields. | `npm run build` passed in `core/skills/app` with Vite `5.4.21`; focused `core.context_bank.ui` passed `8/8`, `1 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip`, PHP `7.4.4`, blog `1526`; feature flag remains false. Enabled-browser, screenshot, mapped deployment and action-route evidence remain pending |

### Context Bank Commerce and diagnostics gate closure - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Commerce probe verdict | Commerce diagnostics aggregate now includes the canonical shipment hook/redaction contract instead of allowing that check to be omitted from the final PASS calculation. | PHP 7.4.4 lint and mapped tenant `1526` focused probe PASS: 14/14 steps, including linked/unlinked relations, replay, shipment/delivery, verified follow and cleanup |
| Provisioning stamp | Context Bank ledger and rollup-state installers now share module stamp `1.3.0`; ledger provisioning no longer downgrades the option from `1.3.0` to `1.1.0`. | Focused KG and Commerce diagnostics output confirmed both installer rows remain at `1.3.0` |
| G4 precondition | Standalone KG fixture was retried on mapped blog `1526` and stopped before mutation because no same-tenant canonical notebook exists. | `status=partial`, `reason=g4_notebook_unavailable`, zero KG/ledger mutations and cleanup PASS; G4 remains deferred |
| G3 correction safety | The standalone Commerce fixture now verifies a late refund correction's `parent_record_id`, deterministic replay, forbidden-field exclusion and cleanup across eight derived pointers. | Mapped blog `1526` fixture PASS for correction/replay/payload safety; overall result remains `partial` only for the missing canonical inventory producer |

### Context Bank retrieval scope evidence - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Scope resolver | Verified posted owner/tenant hints are ignored, current tenant is enforced and retrieval budgets are explicit. | Focused `core.context_bank.scope` probe PASS: 3/3 steps on mapped blog `1526` |
| Retrieval source layer | Verified group-private and unknown-vertical denial, server-owned vertical/hybrid policy, bounded budgets, pre-follow filtering and retrieval-safe owner excerpt dedupe. | Focused `core.context_bank.retrieval` probe PASS: 7/7 steps on mapped blog `1526`; `coverage.complete=false` because this was a filtered component run |

### Context Bank G4 notebook ownership gate - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Notebook authorization | KG bridge and standalone G4 fixture now require the canonical `BizCity_KG_Notebook_Service` owner allowlist before any Context Bank rollup reaches KG source/passage ingestion. | PHP 7.4.4 lint and editor diagnostics PASS; focused KG bridge probe PASS with notebook-authorization ordering and tampered-replay checks |
| Tenant precondition | Read-only lookup found no `bizcity_kg_notebooks` rows on mapped blogs `1511` or `1526`; G4 fixture stopped before mutation on both. | G4 remains `DEFERRED` until an approved same-tenant notebook owned by the explicit operator is supplied |

### Context Bank KG provenance reconciliation - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CB6.4 reconcile | Added bounded `reconcile_provenance()` through the Context Bank ledger and `BizCity_KG::lookup_xref()`; deleted pointers or missing reverse xrefs mark only ledger provenance `stale`, with no direct KG-row deletion. | Focused KG bridge probe PASS 10/10; promoted-row stale/rebuild runtime remains pending until an approved KG notebook canary exists |
| Cron evidence | Added bounded `kg_provenance_stale` reason-bucket event through `BizCity_Cron_Manager::note_event()` when a parent run exists. | PHP 7.4.4 lint/editor diagnostics PASS; retention/legal-hold and full operational aggregate remain pending |

### Payment surface loader isolation - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Woo endpoint detection | Main and compat loaders identify payment/confirmation requests by canonical paths, `pay_for_order=true` plus `key`, and Woo endpoint semantics, so customized customer endpoint slugs do not accidentally boot Twin Brain runtime. | PHP 7.4.4 lint PASS; custom-slug semantic guard smoke PASS; VPS deployment pending |
| Customer plugin isolation | Payment/confirmation requests return before optional Brain, bundled-plugin and legacy helper loading; customer plugin slugs are not scanned or overridden on this path. | Source implemented; production rerun pending |

### Context Bank durable rollup worker - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Rollup state | Added tenant-scoped lease/checkpoint metadata, Site Provisioner/Schema Registry wiring, resumable worker entry and direct diagnostics CLI isolation. | Local and mapped-host worker loading/CLI isolation PASS; standalone local physical lease/checkpoint/resume/cleanup fixture PASS; late-event reopen, interruption recovery, correction replay and synthetic Cron Meta PASS; two-shard and production worker evidence deferred |
| Rollup reducer | Added deterministic event UUID deduplication after canonical ordering, delivery-only exclusion from conversation evidence, first/last message timestamps, channel dimensions and order lifecycle state coverage. | Local and mapped-host focused reducer/worker-isolation probe PASS on blog 1511; standalone physical fixture PASS 12/12; two-shard and production evidence deferred |

### Context Bank worker interruption, replay and Cron Meta - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Interruption recovery | Added bounded checkpoint fault injection and idempotent reuse of a durable rollup pointer when file/ledger success precedes checkpoint persistence. | PHP 7.4 lint PASS; standalone local fixture PASS on blog 1511 |
| Correction replay | Replayed a late correction from canonical source evidence and reused the same output hash/pointer without duplicate ledger admission. | Standalone local fixture PASS; two-shard and production worker evidence remain pending |
| Cron Meta | Added bounded worker `note_event()` records and inspected them through `BizCity_Cron_Manager::with_synthetic_run()`; no production schedule was created. | Synthetic R-CRON-META runtime PASS; production cron aggregate remains pending |

### Context Bank two-shard fixture precondition - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| G1 isolation fixture | Added a fail-closed two-blog fixture that verifies router/keymeta physical identities before provisioning or pointer mutation, then tests per-shard pointer follow, cross-read refusal and cleanup when two distinct shards are available. | PHP 7.4 lint PASS; local blogs 1/2 under mapped host returned `shard_route_mismatch` with the same physical fingerprint, so fixture stopped before mutation; G1 remains blocked pending an approved second shard |

### Context Bank late-event correction worker - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Dirty window | Added schema v1.3.0 dirty metadata and `mark_dirty()` so an older source event reopens one bounded rollup dimension after checkpoint. | R-DCL validator PASS across 36 JSON files; local standalone physical fixture PASS |
| Superseded state | Rebuild reads canonical source pointers, emits a new output hash and preserves the previous rollup via `parent_record_id`; cleanup removes both derived outputs and source fixtures. | PHP 7.4 lint PASS; local blog 1511 fixture PASS 12/12 including interruption recovery, correction replay idempotency and synthetic Cron Meta; two-shard and production worker evidence pending |

### Context Bank standalone physical worker fixture - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Worker validation | Added an explicitly authorized standalone fixture path that can invoke only the registered rollup-state Site Provisioner installer, then runs bounded worker interruption/retry, late-event correction, checkpoint resume and tombstone cleanup outside Diagnostics CLI. | PHP `7.4.4` lint PASS; local blog `1511` fixture PASS 12/12 with `user=3539`; no provider transport or production worker claim |
| Filestore contract | Registered `core.context_bank.rollup` in the shared encrypted business filestore registry so durable rollup output can be admitted before checkpoint advancement. | PHP `7.4.4` lint PASS; fixture encrypted write, ledger admission and checkpoint ordering PASS |

### Context Bank Rule/Skill reference loader - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Adapter loading | Context Bank bootstrap now loads and boots the canonical Rule/Skill reference adapter through Safe Loader, attaching Skill lifecycle hooks without creating a second registry. | PHP `7.4.4` lint PASS; local `core.context_bank.references` probe PASS 4/4 on blog `1526`; MPR owner navigation and live Skill lifecycle write evidence remain pending |

### Context Bank KG and MPR boundaries - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| KG provenance | Added a feature-gated Context Bank to KG-Hub bridge that requires verified stable rollups, routes ingestion through `BizCity_KG`, verifies reverse xref provenance and stamps the original ledger pointer only after the chain succeeds. | PHP 7.4 lint and default-path probe wiring pass; physical-shard canary deferred |
| TwinBrain retrieval | Added bounded authorized Context Bank retrieval metadata to the canonical W0.20 pack with lazy loading and all retrieval-round propagation; notebook top30/top8 selection remains the sole reranker. | PHP 7.4 lint pass; runtime MPR canary deferred |
| Scope safety | Manifest registry is now mandatory for channel admission, and archive tombstones preserve tenant/account/peer/conversation metadata. | PHP 7.4 lint pass; local runtime probe deferred by missing LocalWP DB config |

### Context Bank WooCommerce projection - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Commerce projection | Added the feature-gated `BizCity_Context_Bank_Commerce_Adapter` for Woo payment, status and refund lifecycle events. It writes bounded encrypted order/product metadata and a rebuildable Context Bank pointer; WooCommerce remains canonical. | PHP 7.4 lint, capture-off, local disposable Woo lifecycle fixture and mapped-host disposable lifecycle fixture PASS; explicit unlinked-order no-conversation guard PASS locally; warehouse and shipment/delivery contracts deferred |
| Diagnostics loader | Commerce probe precondition now loads the canonical Context Bank bootstrap through Safe Loader, recovers a partially mounted package by loading only the requested Commerce artifact, and calls idempotent `boot()` before checking the adapter on headless Diagnostics requests. | Local and mapped-host focused rerun PASS; historical precondition skips retained as superseded evidence |

### Context Bank Commerce relationship safety - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Order relation | Commerce projection reads exact `_bizcity_crm_contact_id` and `_bizcity_crm_conversation_id` metadata from the Woo order, records bounded relation dimensions and never performs a latest-ID lookup. | PHP `7.4.4` lint PASS; local `core.context_bank.commerce` probe PASS 11/11 on blog `1526`, including unlinked-order no-conversation behavior; linked relation fixture and warehouse events remain pending |

### Context Bank channel admission continuity - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Channel admission | Added a disposable archive receipt -> Context Bank pointer -> verified follow -> tombstone -> derived-pointer cleanup fixture to the canonical `core.context_bank.channel_admission` probe. The fixture does not create CRM business rows, copy plaintext or call providers. | Local and deployed Runtime PASS on blog 1511 |
| Ledger follow | Translated the ledger's canonical `source_contract_id` to the archive reader's `contract_id` at the verification boundary, preserving pointer-only storage and strict receipt validation. | PHP 7.4 lint, local focused probe and deployed VPS focused probe PASS |

### Context Bank CRM message continuity probe - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CRM continuity | Added `core.context_bank.channel_crm_continuity`, exercising normalized Facebook CRM ingest, encrypted archive receipt, pointer-only Context Bank admission, verified follow, tombstone and disposable cleanup. | Local and mapped-host Runtime PASS on blog 1511; production/provider delivery remains separate |
| Diagnostics isolation | Added the `BIZCITY_DIAGNOSTICS_CLI` callback guard to the CRM autoreply listener after the first fixture run exposed an unintended LLM/outbound path. | PHP 7.4 lint and focused local/mapped-host reruns PASS |

### Diagnostics metadata scan containment - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Diagnostics hot path | Removed physical all-table schema inspection from the standard dashboard widget and repeated critical notice; full inventory remains explicit on the Diagnostics surface. | Implemented locally; VPS Query Monitor comparison pending |
| Schema snapshot | Added a five-minute blog/database/prefix-scoped object-cache with explicit invalidation after additive schema repair and admin Fix actions. | PHP 7.4 lint and IDE diagnostics pass |

### Context Bank memory storage decision - 2026-09-01

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Memory storage | Declared every `bizcity_memory_*` family and legacy `bizcity_memory` SQL payload table as a retirement target. New memory context must use encrypted JSONL/business filestore payloads plus Context Bank references. | Documentation/canonical decision updated; runtime migration and DDV remain pending |
| Context Bank | Clarified that `bizcity_context_bank` is a pointer/correlation ledger only and must not store memory text, decrypted payloads, embeddings or copied JSON. | Canon documented in R-CONTEXT-BANK and Phase 1.33 |

### Retire obsolete Zalo Bot memory builder - 2026-09-01

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Zalo memory | Removed `BizCity_Zalo_Bot_Memory`, its LLM extraction/upsert functions, admin memory page/AJAX action, cron path, and legacy table migration. Zalo memory continues through canonical TwinBrain `Memory_Writer` and `BizCity_User_Memory`. | Implemented locally; runtime/shard zero-row cleanup evidence remains pending |
| Lifecycle | Classified `bizcity_zalo_bot_memory` as retire-only and kept only fail-closed lifecycle metadata for explicit owner-approved cleanup. | Implemented locally; physical table is not dropped automatically |

### Zalo Bot CRM Admin Operations contract - 2026-08-30

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CRM contract | Added `zalo_bot` Admin Operations adapter with `crm_enabled=true`, contract v1.1.0, private/group identity normalization and Automation-owned reply policy. | Implemented locally; WordPress Runtime DDV pending |
| Cross-zone routing | Shared Zalo trigger now resolves Bot, Personal and OA from explicit `platform/code`; unknown payloads fail closed. | Implemented locally; read-only probe updated |
| CRM UI/API | Separated Internal Operations sidebar, added Bot badge, and redacted Contact Care PII/Guru projections for Bot context at the REST boundary. | Implemented locally; browser/runtime smoke pending |
| Log index | Made duplicate `(blog_id,event_uuid)` pointers idempotent, including the concurrent insert race. | Implemented locally; production log verification pending |
| Legacy data | Added evidence-first reconciliation checklist for conversation #13; no data mutation performed. | Pending tenant/shard read-only evidence |

### Cross-channel CRM contract hardening - 2026-09-01

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Registry | Registry cache is blog-scoped, adapter filter key must equal `adapter->code()`, and mismatches are exposed to diagnostics. | Implemented locally; multisite runtime DDV pending |
| Write gate | Added the canonical `require_crm_enabled()` gate to outbound mirrors and made disabled Telegram webhook handling explicit. | Implemented locally; provider/runtime DDV pending |
| Repository write owner | Added a final `incoming/outgoing` channel contract gate in `BizCity_CRM_Repository::insert_message()` so automation, campaign and REST writers cannot bypass channel enablement. | Implemented locally; WordPress Runtime DDV pending |
| UCL identity | Shared Zalo discriminator routing now resolves before identity lookup, and Bot fallback chat IDs use the canonical `_private_` segment. | Implemented locally; channel runtime DDV pending |
| Provenance safety | Conflicting `platform` and `code` discriminators now fail closed at both UCL and CRM ingestor boundaries; a channel label without a registered adapter also cannot write CRM state. | Implemented locally; focused Runtime DDV pending |
| Identity semantics | Documented and gated the distinction between `conversation_chat_id` delivery targets and sender-owned `canonical_session_key` memory identity, especially for group conversations. | Source contract documented; owner-continuity Runtime DDV pending |
| Automation zone routing | Replaced substring `ZALO` matching and ambiguous direct fallback behavior with exact `ZALO_BOT`/legacy `ZALO` admin automation matching; OA/Personal and missing/conflicting discriminators fail closed. | Implemented locally; focused Runtime DDV pending |
| Cross-channel write owner | `upsert_inbox()` and `insert_message()` now require a CRM-enabled registered adapter for new channel/incoming/outgoing state; private notes/system projections remain non-delivery records. | Implemented locally; WordPress Runtime DDV pending |
| Multisite registry | Adapter cache is keyed by current blog plus routed database, and the compatibility `adapter_for()` API now resolves through the validated registry. | Implemented locally; multisite Runtime DDV pending |
| AI policy | CRM auto-reply now derives ownership from the channel contract instead of a hardcoded Zone 2 list. | Implemented locally |
| Safety | Removed the unreferenced duplicate CRM ingestor and parameterized inbox purge subqueries. | Implemented locally; PHP runtime lint pending |

### Controlled legacy SQL writer-stop wave - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Lifecycle policy | Added a six-table JSONL replacement cohort that defaults to `draining`; schema/install and SQL writes are blocked while bounded read fallback remains available during cutover. | Implemented and PHP 7.4 linted |
| Diagnostics | Lifecycle probe now validates the draining read/write matrix, and CRUD-stop rows expose `writer_stop` separately from full SQL read retirement. | Implemented; focused VPS rerun required |
| Automation writer boundary | Generic `action.db_write` now checks `BizCity_Legacy_Table_Policy` before issuing SQL, so the automation whitelist cannot bypass the legacy writer stop. | Implemented and PHP 7.4 linted |
| Memory filestore parity | User, episodic, rolling, session and notes filestore probes now validate canonical owner/file parity independently; unified SQL mirror evidence remains in the separate dual-write probe. | Implemented and PHP 7.4 linted; runtime rerun deferred by bootstrap/shard failure |
| Safety | No `ready_to_drop`, DROP, purge, or destructive cleanup was introduced. | No destructive mutation |

### Vibe Framework Wave 5 runtime adoption - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Reference plugin | Added a real typed KG Source Adapter that ingests a source and passage through the central KG Hub tables without creating a parallel schema. | Runtime PASS: `examples.reference_plugin.wave5` |
| JSONL and pointer ledger | Added reference evidence through `BizCity_JSONL_File_Logger::write_contract()` with a searchable `bizcity_log_index` pointer and exact row hash/offset verification. | Runtime PASS on blog 1526 |
| Diagnostics | Wave 5 probe now passes Disk/Loader/Runtime, including queryable KG rows and pointer follow-through. | PASS 1/1, exit 0, PHP 8.1.34 / WordPress 6.9 |
| Provisioning note | The full provisioning runner remains sensitive to the existing test tenant's missing `wp_1526_options`; Wave 5 evidence was rerun with `--skip-provision --skip-network` after the canonical `log_index` installer provisioned `wp_1526_bizcity_log_index`. | Environment limitation, outside the Wave 5 slice |

### Canonical metadata cache helper - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Core helper | Added `BizCity_Table_Metadata` as the single table/type/column metadata owner with blog/database-scoped static plus object caching, finite TTL and DDL generation invalidation. | Implemented locally; isolated helper smoke passed, WordPress Runtime DDV deferred by an unrelated bootstrap blocker |
| Compatibility | Converted `includes/helpers-table-cache.php` and the knowledge bootstrap polyfill to delegates; `bizcity_known_tables` is no longer metadata truth. | Implemented locally |
| Diagnostics | Added and queued `core.helper.table_metadata` to verify true/false cache hits, database-scoped keys and invalidation. | Source wired; focused probe blocked before execution by existing `class-user-memory.php` runtime error (`undefine()`); no PASS claimed |

### PHASE-1.30 installer metadata invalidation - 2026-09-02

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Site Provisioner | `BizCity_CG_Flow_Installer::ensure_table()` and `BizCity_Log_Index::ensure()` now invalidate the canonical table metadata cache after `dbDelta()` and before checking physical table existence. This prevents a cached false result from hiding a newly created tenant table and leaving the installer version unset. | Implemented locally; target-shard provisioning rerun required |
| Runtime safety | The fix keeps DDL ownership in Site Provisioner and does not add a direct production DROP or SQL fallback. | No destructive mutation |

### Table metadata wrapper load-order fix - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Core helper | Replaced the file-scope `return` before `BizCity_Table_Metadata` wrappers. PHP compile-time class registration made that return execute during the first include, so `bizcity_tbl_exists()` was never defined when Knowledge loaded the canonical helper directly. | Fixed locally; direct PHP wrapper smoke and runtime diagnostics rerun pending |

### SQL CRUD-stop evidence - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Diagnostics | Added `core.legacy_table.crud_stop` for the 23 non-exempt replacement targets. It reports static writer/reader references, lifecycle read/write/install blocking, request-local `SAVEQUERIES` mutation deltas, and per-table blockers without mutating data. | Source wired and PHP 7.4 linted; runtime evidence now executes with `SAVEQUERIES` enabled before `wp-load.php`; current run proves six targets and leaves the remaining targets explicitly blocked/pending |

### Replacement catalog SQL-stop gate - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Diagnostics catalog | `BizCity_Diagnostics_Orphan_Cleaner::preview()` now requires the matching per-table `core.legacy_table.crud_stop` result to be `pass` before a JSONL, filestore, repository, or event-stream replacement can display `DONE`. Parity/file evidence alone no longer produces a green replacement badge. | Implemented locally; runtime catalog refresh uses the latest persisted probe result |

### Step-by-step legacy smoke - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CLI diagnostics | Legacy batch execution now streams each probe result and each CRUD-stop row, reports the independent zero-mutation observation status, persists a checkpoint after every probe, and prints an exact `--resume=<run_id>` command when the bounded run defers. | Implemented locally; PHP 7.4 lint and runtime narrow probe pass for the streaming path |

### CI health verdict diagnostics - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| WP-CLI health | Intentional health precondition skips now produce `warn` with `health_degraded` and explicit skip reasons; executed probe failures remain `fail`. | Implemented locally; prevents a valid degraded health envelope from being rejected as an unexpected verdict |
| GitHub Actions | Health validation now prints the actual verdict, counts and bounded per-probe result when the envelope is rejected. | Implemented locally; next CI run will identify the exact failing/skipped health probe |

### CRUD-stop dynamic reference evidence - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy table audit | Active PHP table references that cannot be tied to an inline SQL operation are now recorded as `indeterminate` instead of being silently treated as `writer_zero=true` and `reader_zero=true`. | Implemented locally; latest probe still records `runtime_mutations_zero=true` while refusing unsupported zero-reader/writer claims |
| Owner parity | Routed the nine-table owner-parity markers to CRUD-stop evidence where the migration decision requires explicit zero-reader/writer or fallback-blocked proof. | Implemented locally; no PASS claimed until the runtime probe executes |

### Twin GPT C-surface identity and CRM PII hardening - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| C-surface scope | `/gpt/` CRM scope is now explicitly resolved as C/customer, so `manage_options` does not inherit tenant-wide Inbox scope. | Implemented locally; two-member Runtime DDV pending |
| Zalo Personal Inbox | Added C-safe conversation/message DTOs and removed the CRM admin serializer from `/gpt/` Personal routes; raw provider/admin metadata is omitted. | Implemented locally; browser and Runtime DDV pending |
| OA projection | Managed Zalo OA projection sync updates only the current member's local owner projection. | Implemented locally; two-key Hub isolation pending |
| Diagnostics | Extended the My Channels probe with C-surface projection/scope markers. | Source wired; WordPress Diagnostics run pending |

### PHASE-0.45 customer-care versus internal operations channel split - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Customer-care UI group | Facebook, Tiktok, Zalo OA and Zalo Personal are now separate customer-care channel items; Web remains planned in the same group. | Implemented locally; provider/runtime smoke pending |
| Internal UI line | Twin GPT and Zalo Bot now share one clearly labelled internal administration line. Zalo Bot is no longer semantically nested as a customer-care Zalo account. | Implemented locally; browser smoke pending |
| Connection ownership | Removed the duplicate Facebook connection panel and duplicate Zalo Bot connect/link controls from the lower My Channels view; `ChannelConnectHub` is now the single connection owner, while the lower panels remain operational-only. Updated the page copy to distinguish customer care from internal operations. | Implemented locally; browser smoke pending |
| Facebook | Existing member-owned Page OAuth/selection stays in the customer-care group with no transport/API contract change. | Existing source retained; production OAuth/DDV pending |
| Zalo Bot | Existing Zone 2 bot-link and automation behavior is preserved, but its placement and explanation now reflect internal administration. | Implemented locally; Zone 2 runtime DDV pending |
| Group lifecycle audit | Added canonical `zalo_bot` JSONL events for group receive, mention match, reply attempt, and reply outcome with hashed chat/message identifiers. | Source complete; webhook/API Runtime DDV pending |
| Group identity privacy | Preserved sender identity for server-side resolution while blocking group `login`, `unlink`, `info`, and `memory` commands from private link/PII handling. | Source complete; group Runtime DDV pending |
| Group linker fallback | Forwarded `chat_kind`, `provider_chat_id`, and `conversation_chat_id` into no-owner memory context; group unlinked traffic now receives public guidance only and cannot trigger a private login URL. Group intake evidence is written before the Zalo Bot database event. | Source complete; group Runtime DDV pending |
| My Workflows checklist reconciliation | Confirmed the existing customer catalog, card-level ON/OFF, preflight, deterministic user-owned copy, and My Channels default injection; kept publish controls, safe settings sheet, and Runtime DDV explicitly open. | Source complete; remaining W9 gates pending |
| My Workflow safe settings sheet | Added owner-scoped `GET /myworkflows/settings` and a responsive read-only customer sheet showing validated channel targets, schedule, copy summary, and recent runs without graph or credential fields. | Source complete; browser/tenant Runtime DDV pending |
| Customer workflow publication | Reconciled PHASE-0.45 with the existing admin-only Customer ON/OFF control that creates a global, customer-default template while keeping customer responses card-based and graph-free. | Source complete; browser/tenant Runtime DDV pending |
| Owner continuity checklist | Confirmed matcher inbound provenance, run `user_id`, runner `_owner_user_id`, and scheduler CRM bridge forwarding; the PHASE-0.45 row is source-complete rather than missing. | Source complete; scheduler completion Runtime DDV pending |
| W4/W5 completion reconciliation | Added the canonical unlinked-user workflow route, AskBrain parity deep-research action/template, parity pack forwarding, and read-only DDV probe; focused Runtime evidence now runs on PHP 7.4.4 / WordPress 6.9 / blog 1526. | Focused Runtime PASS; provider group E2E and tenant/shard aggregate pending |
| Zalo Bot W4/W5 automation | Added canonical unlinked-user workflow routing, `action.ensure_linked_user`, group deep-research template, `action.twinbrain_deep_research`, non-stream Web Deep dispatch, citation preservation, and Runtime forwarding of the AskBrain parity pack. | Focused `web.zalobot.deep_research` PASS; provider/tenant aggregate pending |
| Automation owner continuity | Reconciled the checklist with existing matcher, run repository, runner, and CRM bridge propagation of `_owner_user_id` plus `metadata.inbound` into scheduler events. | Source complete; scheduler completion Runtime DDV pending |
| Connected users and scoped logs | Added admin-only `GET /bizcity-channel/v1/connected-users` with bounded Zalo Bot/Facebook filters and canonical `log_scope` links into the shared Log Explorer. | Source complete; admin/browser/tenant Runtime DDV pending |
| Connected users filter fix | Corrected the unfiltered Facebook projection to include both member-owned and site-shared connections; `wp_user_id` remains an optional narrowing filter. | Source complete; admin/browser/tenant Runtime DDV pending |
| CRM adapter contract matrix | Added `core.channel.crm_adapter_matrix`, a read-only matrix over every registered adapter covering registry provenance, descriptor, minimum normalization, contract acceptance/rejection, and normalized outbound result shape. | Focused Runtime PASS: 11 adapters on PHP 7.4.4 / WordPress 6.9 / blog 1526; provider E2E and tenant aggregate pending |
| Unregistered CRM channel gate | Removed `messenger` from CRM-enabled descriptors because Facebook Messenger is canonically stored under `facebook`; marked it legacy/quarantine and added matrix assertions that `messenger`/`tiktok` stay disabled until an active adapter is registered. | Focused Runtime PASS on blog 1526; dedicated Messenger/TikTok adapter work remains planned |
| Disabled CRM channel REST UX | Added fail-closed `channel_not_configured` envelopes to disabled-channel detail/verify/create wizard paths and Telegram webhook intake, with standard `message`, `hint`, and `help_code=channel_setup`; the adapter matrix now exercises Telegram detail/verify/create synthetically. | Focused Runtime PASS on blog 1526; no CRM/provider side effect observed |
| Disabled writer isolation | Added `core.channel.crm_disabled_writer` with a disposable schema-compatible Telegram fixture; repository incoming/outgoing writers and manual REST writer are proven to stop before message mutation or provider event dispatch. | Focused Runtime PASS on PHP 7.4.4 / WordPress 6.9 / blog 1526; provider E2E remains pending |
| Legacy conversation reconciliation preview | Added a current-tenant, read-only preview runner and admin REST route with exact Bot/OA evidence classification, unknown quarantine, canonical metadata/routing gate, and `dry_run=false` rejection; no reconciliation mutation is shipped. | Focused Runtime PASS on PHP 7.4.4 / WordPress 6.9 / blog 1526; zero legacy candidates in this tenant, #13 reconciliation remains pending |
| F8 Repository table-helper fix | Corrected member CRM task/contact/order-care reads to resolve table names through `BizCity_CRM_DB_Installer_V2` instead of undefined Repository methods. | `modules.twin_gpt.crm_member_scope` and `modules.crm.team_assignment_kanban` focused Runtime PASS on blog 1526 |
| Internal PHPUnit recheck | Ran PHPUnit 9.6.36 with the repository bootstrap and `ABSPATH` preloaded before Composer autoload; repaired upload-root cache isolation, shared multisite test stubs, `ARRAY_A` compatibility and the exact-account assertion. | PASS: 32 tests / 138 assertions on PHP 7.4.4 |
| TwinWeb narrow probe recheck | Re-ran member scope, customer channels/automation, owner continuity, app catalog and shortcode surfaces; fixed the stale Profile Care deeplink expectation and enabled Safe Loader CLI loading for TwinWeb probes. | Focused Runtime PASS on PHP 7.4.4 / WordPress 6.9 / blog 1526; provider/browser/aggregate gates remain pending |
| TwinWeb UIS Runtime recheck | Ran Appearance, Skin Renderer and Shortcode Surfaces probes through the PHP CLI after enabling direct CLI probe loading; corrected explicit Profile Care parent-path expectation. | Focused Runtime PASS on PHP 7.4.4 / WordPress 6.9 / blog 1526; browser/mobile smoke remains pending |
| Zalo Bot provider side-effect matrix | Added diagnostics-only mock transport and rollback-safe `core.channel.zalobot_crm_provider_matrix` covering inbound retry dedupe, exact Bot/private outbound routing, CRM mirror, delivery status/retryable outcome and two-Bot isolation. | PASS: PHP 7.4.4 / WordPress 6.9 / blog 1526 with `--skip-network`; live provider E2E remains pending |
| Twin GPT CSS scope boundary | Applied the `bizcity-twin-embed` scope class to every Twin GPT mount root so Tailwind utilities generated with `important: '.bizcity-twin-embed'` match in Vite and production bundles. | PASS: Vite build; styled desktop/mobile browser artifact with no horizontal overflow |
| PHASE-0.41 CRM One Brain roadmap | Added the all-channel manifest/SDK/Context Bank roadmap, current Zalo/Messenger assessment, future Slack/TikTok/Shopee acceptance kit and `/gpt/` employee Woo order/payment/shipping/lead-time waves. Restored bare `messenger` and generic `zalo` to legacy/quarantine because no matching Messenger adapter manifest exists. | Public contract suite PASS (19); CRM adapter matrix PASS (11 adapters); Context Bank ledger focused Runtime PASS on blog 1526; roadmap remains PRE-IMPLEMENTATION |
| Roadmap | Updated PHASE-0.45 and project tracker with the two-group information architecture and release gates. | Documented |
| Contract hardening follow-up | Corrected the canonical Zone rule so `zalo_bot` may persist in CRM Admin Operations while remaining outside Customer Care; made `core.channel.zone_isolation` the sole canonical probe ID and marked source-only checklist rows as Runtime-DDV pending. | Source/probe wiring complete; tenant-safe WordPress Runtime DDV pending |

### PHASE-0.49 CRM employee Inbox readiness documentation gate - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical checklist | Added the employee readiness checklist for Inbox menu/capability, read/write scope, managed versus self-managed Zalo OA routing, canonical OA identity, redacted logging and the admin/employee A/B/provider/self-echo matrix. | Documentation canonical; no Runtime PASS claimed |
| CRM roadmap | Linked PHASE-0.49 from CRM Operating Suite, CRM Roadmap and the master Project Roadmap. | Documented; employee browser/runtime smoke pending |
| Release decision | Kept CRM employee usage PRE-RELEASE until T1-T12, Diagnostics Disk/Loader/Runtime and production Zalo OA evidence pass. | PRE-RELEASE |

### Enterprise Brain Context Accumulation Loop - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | Defined the canonical `CRM/Woo truth -> encrypted context archive -> bounded digest/source -> Notebook -> selective KG promotion -> MPR/TwinBrain retrieval` loop. The existing Channel Conversation Archive remains the recovery/context precursor; no parallel conversation store is permitted. | Documented; runtime bridge remains an explicit implementation gap |
| Storage contract | Added `context_corpus` to the storage decision gate and required contract ownership, tenant scope, provenance, bounded batch relearning, and no full archive scan in the MPR hot path. | Documented; archive contract registration and DDV remain pending |

### CRM context accumulation roadmap - 2026-08-29

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Roadmap | Added `PHASE-1.31-CRM-CONTEXT-ACCUMULATION.md` covering the existing archive contract adapter, canonical CRM/Woo correlation event, digest/source lifecycle, selective KG promotion, contact/order-scoped MPR projection, rollback and DDV acceptance. | Design only; no runtime bridge or schema change shipped |

### TwinShell core CRM and Channels availability - 2026-08-27

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| TwinShell | CRM is now a default Free-plan core capability alongside Channels; removed the stale `pro` plan and `BizCity_Twin_CRM` dependency gates that sent Free users to the upgrade notice. | Implemented locally; TwinShell browser smoke pending |
| Documentation | Updated TwinShell membership/activity examples to use the Free-plan core CRM contract. | Implemented locally |

### TwinShell F5 and API settings single-frame fix - 2026-08-27

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Admin route | Registered the legacy `bizcity-twinchat` redirect during bootstrap so it runs at `admin_init`, before wp-admin output. | Implemented locally |
| Deployed compatibility | Added a TwinShell guard that escapes an already-rendered legacy admin wrapper and preserves the active deep-link. | Implemented locally |
| API settings | Preserved `bizcity_iframe=1` after saving LLM settings and hid duplicate wp-admin chrome in the embedded settings document. | Implemented locally; browser smoke pending |

### Marketplace fallback logo and TwinShell single-frame routing - 2026-08-27

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Marketplace | Added a local default plugin logo for bundle cards and detail views when cover/icon metadata is missing. | Implemented locally |
| Lifecycle | Loaded the WordPress plugin API before checking `is_plugin_active()` during activation. | Implemented locally |
| TwinShell | Changed the legacy `bizcity-twinchat` admin route to redirect to `/twin/` instead of embedding a second TwinShell iframe. | Implemented locally; browser smoke pending |
| Documentation | Recorded the Marketplace, optional-plugin, namespace, channel-ownership, and TwinShell decisions in `docs/architecture/PHASE-1.29-MARKETPLACE-TWINSHELL.md`. | Implemented locally |

### PHASE-1.30 legacy table lifecycle controls - 2026-08-26

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime policy | Added `BizCity_Legacy_Table_Policy` with per-blog `quarantine`, `draining`, `ready_to_drop` and `dropped` states; retired tables return before install/read/write. | Implemented locally; runtime DDV pending |
| Drop gate | Orphan Cleaner now requires explicit `ready_to_drop` plus approval reference and zero rows; `Force re-run` cannot bypass the gate. | Implemented locally; runtime DDV pending |
| Uninstall | Added main-plugin `uninstall.php`; uninstall delegates only approved empty legacy-table cleanup and is idempotent. | Implemented locally; runtime DDV pending |
| Diagnostics | Added `core.legacy_table.lifecycle` read-only DDV and displays policy state/approval in quarantine review. | Source wired; WordPress Diagnostics pending |
| Roadmap | Added multi-sprint wave plan and per-table completion checklist in `docs/roadmaps/PHASE-1.30-LEGACY-TABLE-LIFECYCLE.md`. | Active / pre-release |

### Deprecated table quarantine audit - 2026-08-26

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Quarantine gates | Added explicit owner/migration gates for legacy memory, Zalo memory, KG progress and legacy automation tables; active log, billing and usage tables remain quarantine-only. | Implemented locally; Diagnostics page verification pending |
| Cleanup state | Invalidate table metadata after a successful orphan-table DROP so the catalog does not show stale `exists=true` state in the same request. | Implemented locally; Diagnostics page verification pending |
| UI policy | Clarified that quarantine entries require owner sign-off, while non-quarantine orphan candidates require physical existence and `COUNT(*)=0`. | Implemented locally; Diagnostics page verification pending |

### Nested optional plugin lifecycle from plugins.php - 2026-08-26

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Plugin management | Added management-only virtual rows for installed `bizcity-tool-content`, `bizcity-tool-image`, and `bizcity-content-creator` artifacts; lifecycle actions use normal WordPress `active_plugins` state without auto-loading them. | Implemented locally; WordPress admin smoke pending |
| Deactivation | Deactivation now preserves plugin-owned data. All three optional extensions use WordPress's manual `active_plugins` state. | Implemented locally; WordPress admin smoke pending |
| Uninstall | Explicit Uninstall runs the guarded plugin teardown before removing the nested artifact directory. | Implemented locally; WordPress admin smoke pending |

### TwinShell Marketplace workspace entry - 2026-08-26

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| TwinShell | Added Marketplace as an embedded Activity Bar entry immediately before Reminders, targeting `index.php?page=bizcity-marketplace`. | Implemented locally; TwinShell browser smoke pending |
| Market surface | Main loader now loads the canonical Market bootstrap on Marketplace requests while retaining the lightweight `plugins.php` path. | Implemented locally; deployed runtime smoke pending |

### Nested Video Kling catalog discovery - 2026-08-26

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Market catalog | Bumped the agent-plugin sync cache to `v4` so the explicit nested-plugin scan discovers `plugins/bizcity-video-kling` without activating it or adding it to `must_load`. | Implemented locally; deploy and Sync Agent Plugins pending |

### Automatic nested bundle catalog reconciliation - 2026-08-26

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Market catalog | Nested bundle entrypoints are fingerprinted before the 24-hour throttle; adding or replacing an inactive bundled plugin now triggers catalog sync automatically. | Implemented locally; deployed Marketplace smoke pending |

### Marketplace render-time bundle reconciliation - 2026-08-26

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Market catalog | Local Marketplace now reconciles nested bundle artifacts immediately before rendering, accepts a valid agent/tool entrypoint even when its filename differs from the directory slug, and bumps the sync stamp to `v5` to force the first post-deploy rescan. | Implemented locally; deployed Marketplace smoke pending |

### Diagnostics schema cascade and dist-only evidence - 2026-08-26

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Provisioning | Registered the native Automation installer with the central Site Provisioner and exposed bounded installer outcomes in the CLI runner. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Schema cache | Invalidated negative table metadata after Auto-Create and fresh Scheduler DDL, preventing newly created tables from being reported as missing in the same request. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| CRM schema | Let Diagnostics CLI reconcile CRM additive column/index drift from the canonical changelog, including when the stored schema version is already current. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Diagnostics evidence | Report missing schema columns and publish bounded JUnit failure details in the GitHub Actions Step Summary. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Dist-only deployments | PageBuilder, CRM F5/F6 and Twin GPT CRM probes now require backend/built artifacts while treating absent development-only React source as `SKIP`. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |

### PHASE-0.39F F5 inbound assignment and F6 conversation board — 2026-08-25

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| F5 assignment | Connected auto-assignment to the canonical `crm_conversation_opened` event for new conversations and added `team_id`, `policy_id` and `reason` to repository-owned assignment events. | Local integrated foundation; concurrency, capacity, no-candidate and Runtime DDV pending |
| F6 board | Added RTK Query board APIs, five-lane Conversation Board, list/board toggle and scoped REST drag/drop with idempotency keys. | Local FE partial; task/opportunity commands, runtime idempotency and browser smoke pending |
| Validation | Rebuilt CRM `assets/dist/inbox-app.js` and `inbox-app.css`; responsive board and Inbox collapse controls compile successfully. | `npm run build` passed; production WordPress/DDV evidence pending |

### PHASE-0.39F F5/F6 DDV probe and retry safety - 2026-08-25

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Diagnostics | Added read-only `modules.crm.team_assignment_kanban` Disk/Loader/Runtime probe for the F5 assignment hook, F6 routes and normalized no-mutation outcome. | Source wired; WordPress Diagnostics run pending |
| Board retry | Board move now requires a bounded idempotency key and returns `already_applied` when status/team/assignee already match; unassigned columns follow status semantics. | Local implementation; fixture and production DDV pending |

### PHASE-0.39F F7/F8 member CRM scope projection - 2026-08-25

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| F7 scope | Added structured `BizCity_CRM_Inbox_Access::resolve_scope()` with admin/owner-or-member/empty scope, inbox IDs, channel types and safe field-projection flags while preserving the legacy ID API. | Local partial; provider-specific ownership union and two-user isolation pending |
| F8 projection | Added identity-first `/bizcity-twinweb/v1/crm/me`, repository member filters and read-only conversations, care tasks and Woo order summaries in the existing My Channels owner screen. | Local backend/UI partial; Runtime DDV and browser smoke pending |
| Diagnostics | Added and queued `modules.twin_gpt.crm_member_scope` read-only Disk/Loader/Runtime probe. | Source wired; WordPress Diagnostics run pending |

### PHASE-0.39F concrete sprint execution plan - 2026-08-25

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| S0-S3 | Documented contract freeze, two-user `/crm/me` isolation, F5 assignment matrix/concurrency and F6 task/opportunity move/idempotency tests. | Plan recorded; runtime fixtures pending |
| S4-S6 | Documented F2 archive receipt/hash round-trip, offload pilot gate, F3 dashboard parity/non-admin scope and F7 provider owner mapping. | Plan recorded; runtime evidence pending |
| S7-S9 | Documented `/gpt/`, My Channels and CRM Inbox browser smoke, bridge BD-4..BD-6 deployment/drills and final release/rollback review. | Plan recorded; production DDV pending |

### PHASE-0.39F S1 identity boundary hardening - 2026-08-25

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| F8 projection | CRM projection now rejects a stale or forged identity object before scope resolution or CRM reads; mismatch returns a degraded empty projection. | Implemented locally; two-user Runtime fixture pending |
| Diagnostics | Extended `modules.twin_gpt.crm_member_scope` with read-only forged identity and posted `owner_id`/`inbox_id`/`account_id` assertions. | Source wired; WordPress Diagnostics run pending |
| Checklist | Marked only the local hardening/editor-diagnostics item in Sprint 1; A/B fixture, cache invalidation and field-redaction Runtime checks remain open. | ACTIVE / PRE-RELEASE |

### PHASE-0.39F S2 assignment transaction event safety - 2026-08-25

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| F5 assignment | Repository assignment/team mutations can suppress events inside the transaction; the assignment service emits the committed transition after `COMMIT` using the pre-mutation snapshot. | Implemented locally; concurrency and rollback Runtime fixture pending |
| Diagnostics | Extended `modules.crm.team_assignment_kanban` with a read-only deferred-event API contract check. | Source wired; WordPress Diagnostics run pending |
| Checklist | Marked only the local transaction event-safety item in Sprint 2; candidate matrix, concurrency and no-admin-fallback Runtime checks remain open. | ACTIVE / PRE-RELEASE |

### PHASE-0.39F S3 order-care move foundation - 2026-08-25

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| F6 command | Added repository-owned, scoped task/opportunity move command with state allowlist, ownership check, normalized outcomes, event emission and Kanban cache invalidation. | Implemented locally; durable idempotency and Runtime fixture pending |
| F6 REST | Added `bizcity-crm/v1/boards/order-care/move` with bounded `idempotency_key`, object type/id, target state and optional changes payload. | Source wired; WordPress route and authorization run pending |
| Diagnostics | Extended `modules.crm.team_assignment_kanban` with route and invalid-object no-mutation checks. | Source wired; WordPress Diagnostics run pending |
| Checklist | Marked only the local S3 command foundation item; valid move matrix, conflict/timeout replay and Woo HPOS invariance remain open. | ACTIVE / PRE-RELEASE |

### PHASE-0.39F Group Inbox normalization and filtering - 2026-08-25

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Inbound | Forwarded Zalo Personal `thread_kind`, `thread_id`, `group_id` and `group_name`; group mappings retain `thread_kind=group`. | Implemented locally; Runtime group fixture pending |
| CRM | Multiple group senders now share `group:<thread_id>` as the CRM source key while sender identity remains message metadata. | Implemented locally; old flattened-contact reconciliation pending |
| Inbox UI | Added shared group/private selector for list and board, group DTO/card fields and export filter parity. | CRM build passed; browser/runtime evidence pending |
| Outbound | Propagated `thread_kind=group` through client, Hub client and ZCA route so Group replies do not target a user recipient. | ZCA build and regression suite passed; deployed bridge evidence pending |
| Diagnostics | Added read-only `modules.crm.group_inbox` probe and queued it in central Diagnostics. | Source wired; WordPress Diagnostics run pending |

### PHASE-0.39F Group Inbox self-echo contract - 2026-08-26

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Self-echo | Native Zalo Personal group self-echo mappings now retain `thread_kind=group` alongside the `group:<thread_id>` source key. | Implemented locally; Runtime self-echo fixture pending |
| Probe | `modules.crm.group_inbox` now verifies group identity and sender metadata survive the shared pre-SQL CRM contract. | Source wired; WordPress Diagnostics run pending |
| Release gate | Two-sender one-conversation, outbound Group delivery and old flattened-contact reconciliation remain open. | ACTIVE / PRE-RELEASE |

### PHASE-0.39F Group Inbox Runtime checklist and master follow-up - 2026-08-26

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 6B checklist | Made Group Inbox a canonical operational checklist with an authenticated `confirm=GROUP_INBOX` Diagnostics command, transaction rollback expectations and five Runtime/reconciliation gates. | Implemented locally; Runtime execution blocked on local environment |
| Master roadmap | Added G1-G5 follow-up table for one group thread, native self-echo, outbound Group, legacy-contact decision and evidence/rollback closure. | Tracker updated to v3.15 |
| Execution result | Local attempt cannot run because PHP CLI and a reachable WordPress HTTP listener are unavailable; no Runtime PASS is claimed. | BLOCKED/SKIP; run on deployed tenant |

### PHASE-0.39F Group Inbox fixture safety gate - 2026-08-26

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime fixture | Tightened `confirm=GROUP_INBOX` so full PASS requires the actual native emitter branch with a mapped diagnostic account; without it, normalization/native-mirror checks may pass but the fixture is `SKIP`. | Implemented locally; deployed WordPress fixture pending |
| Safety | Synthetic CRM writes remain inside a transaction and roll back; no production message is sent by the standard Diagnostics fixture. | Source validated; Runtime evidence pending |
| Master follow-up | Registered `SPRINT-69 PHASE-0.39F-GROUP-INBOX-RUNTIME-CHECKLIST` and canonical G1-G5 tracking in the master roadmap. | ACTIVE / PRE-RELEASE |

### CI clean checkout and diagnostics activation gate - 2026-08-25

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Packaging | Stopped excluding the active `plugins/bizcity-profile/` module from Git, which caused the clean-checkout activation fatal for the required Profile wheel provider. | Implemented locally; push required |
| CI | Added a shipped-tree preflight before `wp plugin activate` so missing runtime artifacts fail with an actionable path. | Implemented locally |
| CRM loader | Proprietary CRM now skips a partial deployment instead of aborting Diagnostics; Inbox Access accepts both canonical flat and legacy reorganized paths. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Trace gate | Added a CI check that rejects the stale CRM bootstrap which directly required `includes/inbox/class-inbox-access.php` and stopped Diagnostics with exit code 255. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Main loader | Main plugin now skips incomplete proprietary CRM artifacts before the legacy bootstrap can execute; public framework Diagnostics continues without CRM. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Memory schema | Existing unified memory tables now use Diagnostics Auto-Create for additive repair; `dbDelta()` is limited to fresh creation to avoid invalid `ALTER ... ADD` output during CI. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Diagnostics schema guard | Diagnostics CLI now routes fresh and partial Unified Memory tables through the JSON-backed Auto-Create owner and blocks `dbDelta()` fallback when that owner is unavailable. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| CI runner parity | Preflight now requires `BizCity_Site_Provisioner::run_all( true )` in `bin/diagnostics-run.php` and rejects the retired direct-installer sequence before probe execution. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Scheduler migration | Scheduler now skips historical CREATE/RENAME steps when canonical `bizcity_crm_events` is already provisioned, avoiding duplicate-table noise and protecting the automation publish probe. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Scheduler CI gate | Added a shipped-tree preflight requiring the canonical Scheduler migration guard before the Diagnostics matrix starts. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Diagnostics schema loader | Diagnostics bootstrap now loads the changelog loader and additive Auto-Create owner before schema installers and probes, removing Memory Unified repair ordering ambiguity. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Diagnostics loader CI gate | CI now rejects a diagnostics bootstrap that does not preload the R-DCL changelog loader and Auto-Create owner before Site Provisioner/probes. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Memory schema evidence | Unified Memory now logs bounded Auto-Create `action/errors` reason buckets when reconciliation fails, allowing the next CI run to distinguish JSON, CREATE, and ADD-only schema failures without exposing full SQL. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Production loader hardening | Profile wheel provider is optional at bootstrap, and KG-Hub owns registration of the `bizcity_kg_5min` interval used by filestore migration cron hooks. | Implemented locally; production deploy verification pending |
| Safe loader rule | Added `BizCity_Safe_Loader` core helper and migrated the Profile bootstrap module artifacts to guarded loading with bounded missing/load-failure evidence. | Implemented locally; production deploy verification pending |
| Safe loader CI enforcement | Added a shipped-tree CI guard rejecting raw Profile module/probe `require_once` calls and requiring both Profile entrypoints to use the core Safe Loader. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Global bootstrap rule | Elevated R-SAFE-LOADER to Tier 0 for `plugins/`, `core/`, and `modules/`; added changed/strict validator modes with an initial inventory of 46 bootstrap files and 1,037 legacy raw requires. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |
| Roadmap | Made the two PHASE-1.24 audit roadmaps trackable and recorded the remaining WordPress matrix and Diagnostics JUnit gates. | Implemented locally; CI rerun pending |

### Facebook webhook dùng duy nhất callback Plan B — 2026-08-25

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Channel Gateway | Loại bỏ URL Plan A và Plan A fallback khỏi REST settings/UI; `/?fbhook=1` là callback Facebook chính thức duy nhất. | Implemented locally; frontend artifact build passed |

### Profile shared Twin GPT SSE and no-notebook chat — 2026-08-25

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Transport | Profile public React chat now consumes the canonical TwinWeb `/chat/stream` SSE event contract with live token rendering and synchronous fallback. | Implemented locally; WordPress runtime SSE smoke pending |
| Identity | Profile stream verifies signed Profile context, keeps WEBCHAT/Guru/CRM attribution and Profile session prefix through completion. | Implemented locally; runtime CRM stream smoke pending |
| Grounding | Profile forces `mode=chat`, ignores notebook focus and injects canonical public Profile context into the shared runtime prompt. | Implemented locally; answer-quality smoke pending |

### PHASE-0.39F CRM progress snapshot and Inbox column collapse — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| F5 assignment | Added assignment policy CRUD/binding, fair-count and capacity selection, tenant lock/transaction, scoped auto-assign REST command and no-admin-fallback outcomes. | Local foundation implemented; canonical inbound trigger, idempotency and concurrency DDV pending |
| F6 Kanban | Added scoped conversation/order-care projections, repository-backed conversation move command and cache invalidation without creating CRM order/Kanban shadow tables. | Local foundation implemented; FE adoption, task/opportunity commands and browser/DDV pending |
| Inbox UI | Added independent collapse controls to Channels, Conversation List, Conversation and Contact columns; collapsed tracks use `44px` and responsive selectors preserve tablet/mobile behavior. | CRM frontend build and artifact smoke passed; browser visual smoke pending |
| Release status | Added dated progress snapshot and synchronized PHASE-0.39F/master tracker status. | Overall 0.39F remains ACTIVE / PRE-RELEASE; F2/F3/F7/F8 and bridge BD-4..BD-6 gates remain open |

### Floating brain Hero polish and compact chat launcher — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Hero | Replaced the unstable circular force layout with a stable two-hemisphere neural mesh, multicolor links and floating brain aura. | Implemented locally; browser visual smoke pending |
| Chat float | Replaced the oversized closed pill with a circular icon-only launcher; the readable chat headline and prompt input appear after opening the panel. | Implemented locally; browser chat smoke pending |
| Deployment gate | Profile diagnostics now requires the compact launcher, neural mesh and public chat panel markers. | Implemented locally |

### Floating brain neuron Hero and visible prompt — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Hero visual | Increased the public graph field to a dense two-hemisphere neuron silhouette with cross-links, aura and central fissure treatment. | Implemented locally; browser visual smoke pending |
| Prompt | Public React chat now shows an input composer immediately instead of requiring a launcher first. | Implemented locally; browser chat smoke pending |
| Data boundary | Ambient points are unlabeled visual-only particles; labeled nodes remain limited to the published public graph/capability allowlist. | Implemented locally |

### Public Profile graph density and prompt composer — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Hero graph | Added ambient visual points and low-emphasis ring links when the public snapshot has few nodes, while keeping labeled nodes limited to public-safe data. | Implemented locally; browser visual smoke pending |
| Chat prompt | Added an always-visible React prompt composer in the public Profile chat surface; Enter and Send use the canonical Profile chat route. | Implemented locally; browser chat smoke pending |
| Diagnostics | The deployed public artifact gate now requires the Hero graph, highlight event and visible prompt composer markers. | Implemented locally |

### Public Profile Hero graph visualization — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Hero | Ported a public-safe read-only SVG graph into the Profile Hero/cover position with category colors, curved relations, drag, zoom and pulse effects. | Implemented locally; browser visual smoke pending |
| Chat reaction | Chat questions and answers broadcast public label matches; the Hero highlights matched nodes and connected relations while dimming unrelated nodes. | Implemented locally; runtime graph snapshot smoke pending |
| Privacy | The graph reads only the server-published `publicGraphSnapshot` or `publicCapabilities`; no notebook/KG query, drawer or edit action is exposed publicly. | Implemented locally |

### Public Profile React chat foundation — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Public mount | Added a dedicated `profile-public.js` React entrypoint for public Profile WebChat, while preserving Page Builder HTML as the SEO/no-JS fallback. | Implemented locally; browser/runtime WordPress smoke pending |
| Chat contract | React chat reuses the existing signed `channel_context`, `chat_turn`, `profile_webchat_{card_id}_*` session and canonical CRM/TwinBrain handler. | Implemented locally |
| Performance | Public Profile no longer needs to load the 412 KB dashboard bundle; dedicated chat artifact is about 153 KB before gzip. | Implemented locally |

### Profile Public and editor UX fixes — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Editor | Moved Avatar/Cover controls into the Hero panel and added a Template-tab artifact gate plus production asset-version bump. | Implemented locally; production deployment/cache purge pending |
| Avatar | Added a profile icon fallback for empty or broken avatar URLs in Profile Edit, Page Builder canvas and public export. | Implemented locally |
| Public assistant | Renamed the public CTA to “Hỏi quản gia của tôi” and made it open the actual WebChat launcher. | Implemented locally; browser smoke pending |

### Profile Edit template picker — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Template tab | Added a Profile Edit tab that loads the three server-owned Profile templates and applies a selected layout after explicit confirmation. | Implemented locally; browser/runtime WordPress smoke pending |
| Preservation | Template switching keeps owner Profile/Twin/CTA/slug/capability data, `profileCardId`, and the canonical CF7 lead form, then republishes already-published cards. | Implemented locally; aggregate Profile Diagnostics pending |
| Safety | Added an owner-scoped REST route and diagnostics contract; no new table, browser file path, Membership or entitlement logic. | Implemented locally |

### Page Builder canvas parity for Profile portfolio — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas renderers | Added `timeline` features, `progress` stats, Portfolio/Blog metadata cards and Portfolio category filter to the Page Builder canvas preview. | Implemented locally; browser editor smoke pending |
| Canvas layout | Canvas now mirrors unique block anchors and the responsive `vcard_portfolio` sidebar/main composition used by public export. | Implemented locally; browser editor smoke pending |
| Safety | Canvas filtering is local to the preview iframe; no CRM, provider, visitor or public-page side effects are introduced. | Implemented locally |

### PHASE-0.39F CRM framework storage and operations foundations — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Archive F1 | Expanded encrypted conversation archive to active Zone 1 channels and added redacted attachment refs. | Implemented locally; per-channel runtime/DDV pending |
| Hybrid storage F2 | Added storage lifecycle fields, archive receipt index, bounded offload method and read-only cold rehydrate path. | Foundation implemented; pilot activation and round-trip DDV pending |
| Reporting F3 | Added content-free reporting facts, daily rollup tables/writer and scoped `/reports/rollups` endpoint with cache. | Foundation implemented; migrate existing dashboards and validate metric parity |
| Teams/assignment F4-F5 | Added tenant-local Teams, Team Members, Inbox Members, capabilities, policy CRUD/binding and scoped assignment foundations; manual assignment now checks membership. | Foundation implemented; canonical inbound trigger, fair-distribution fixtures, UI and DDV pending |
| Owner scope F7 | `BizCity_CRM_Inbox_Access` now unions explicit Inbox Members with the existing Zalo Personal owner scope. | Partial; provider-specific ownership and field projection remain |

### CRM archive channel coverage — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Zone 1 archive | Expanded encrypted conversation archive to Facebook, Messenger, Zalo OA, Zalo Personal, WebChat, Email, Instagram and WhatsApp. Normalized legacy adapter aliases (`email_imap`, `web_widget`, `whatsapp_cloud`, `zalo`) to canonical archive channels. | Implemented locally; deployed per-channel archive DDV pending |
| Attachment archive refs | Archive rows now include attachment ID/type, keyed hashes, bounded size and MIME metadata without raw provider URLs. | Implemented locally; media fixture and retention/reconcile DDV pending |
| Hybrid offload | No SQL content offload was enabled by this slice. Archive receipt/lifecycle contract remains a prerequisite before clearing message content. | Intentionally pending F2 |

### Profile portfolio fidelity pass — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Resume | Added an additive `timeline` variant to the existing features renderer and ported the source education/experience structure. | Implemented locally; public browser smoke pending |
| Skills | Added an additive `progress` variant to the existing stats renderer for source-style skill bars. | Implemented locally; public browser smoke pending |
| Content cards | Portfolio and Blog entries now support title/date/description metadata while retaining the existing gallery contract. | Implemented locally |

### Profile portfolio interaction port — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Layout | Ported the source vCard responsive desktop sidebar/main composition using existing Page Builder output; it collapses to one column on mobile. | Implemented locally; public browser smoke pending |
| Portfolio filter | Added reusable category filtering for gallery blocks and enabled it on the portfolio template with All, Web design, Applications and Web development categories. | Implemented locally; public browser smoke pending |
| Source boundary | Ported visual language and interaction behavior only; no vendor HTML/CSS/JS was copied, and Profile WebChat, lead-form/CRM and tracking mounts remain canonical. | Implemented locally |

### CRM Channel Framework contract gate — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Channel input | Added `BizCity_CRM_Channel_Contract` validation before shared CRM SQL: stable inbox/source/dedupe identity, content type, attachments, zone, storage and TwinBrain descriptors. | Implemented locally; multi-channel runtime DDV pending |
| Channel output | Normalized adapter outcomes to `success`, `outcome`, `code`, `external_source_id`, `error`, `retryable`, `channel_code` and `contract_version`. | Implemented locally |
| CRM write ownership | Moved outbound message status mutation into `BizCity_CRM_Repository::update_message_delivery()`; REST no longer writes message status directly. | Implemented locally; PHP runtime smoke pending |
| Zone and catalog | Registry/REST channel catalog now exposes the framework descriptor; Zone 2 adapter ingress is rejected by the shared CRM gate, with T-M1.4 synthetic valid-input and Telegram rejection probes. | Implemented locally; deployed Diagnostics PASS and producer ownership migration pending |
| TwinBrain | Kept one `crm_message_received` AI listener owner and documented that full canonical TwinBrain parity is still pending for Personal/WebChat/Email/other Zone 1 channels. | Contract documented; parity work remains roadmap |

### Profile portfolio template port — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Template | Added `business-card-portfolio.json`, porting the supplied vCard Personal Portfolio structure into existing Page Builder blocks: About, Resume, Portfolio, Blog, Contact, services, testimonials, clients and skills. | Implemented locally; public browser smoke pending |
| Visual language | Added the `vcard_portfolio` Profile preset with Poppins, dark surfaces and yellow accent while preserving Profile WebChat, vCard, lead-form and CRM contracts. | Implemented locally; public browser smoke pending |
| Navigation | Page Builder section anchors now use unique block IDs, so repeated `content`/`gallery` sections remain reachable from the portfolio navbar. | Implemented locally; Page Builder build PASS |

### Profile portfolio snapshot and KG graph redaction — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Portfolio | Publish now creates a bounded `publicPortfolioSnapshot` from allowlisted public Page Builder blocks; forms, shortcodes, custom HTML and team/private payloads are excluded. | Implemented locally; publish/browser smoke pending |
| Graph privacy | `publicGraphSnapshot` accepts only server-authorized graph input through `bizcity_profile_public_graph_snapshot`, then allowlists node/edge fields, caps sizes and drops invalid references/private fields. | Implemented locally; trusted KG provider and runtime privacy smoke pending |
| Freshness | Added `graph_hash` alongside the capability `content_hash` so published graph changes have an independent fingerprint. | Implemented locally |
| Scope | No live KG query, CRM query, new table or Membership entitlement policy was added to public rendering. | Implemented locally |

### Profile editor accent-aware link preview — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Editor preview | Added a compact live preview for populated contact, social and messaging links; icon/border/background accents follow `brainAccentColor`. | Implemented locally; browser smoke pending |
| Scope | Presentation-only change; Profile REST, CRM ownership and Membership entitlement contracts are unchanged. | Implemented locally |

### Profile gift provider fallback — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Public resilience | Profile renderer now shows a neutral fallback when the selected Gift Wheel provider is unavailable or returns no public markup; chat and portfolio remain available. | Implemented locally; public browser smoke pending |

### Profile Funnel DDV contract expansion — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Public snapshot probe | Extended `modules.personal.profile.wave62` with an in-memory privacy fixture for `publicGraphSnapshot`, including allowlisted fields and content-hash verification. | Implemented locally; Diagnostics rerun pending |
| Surface probe | Added deployed artifact checks for Profile Care/Public navigation and a side-effect-free loader check for the canonical WebChat CRM adapter/ingestor. | Implemented locally; WordPress runtime evidence pending |
| CRM attribution fixture | Profile WebChat now carries the real `profile_card_id` and `profile_public` source through normalization; the probe verifies stable external message ID and card attribution without CRM writes. | Implemented locally; CRM runtime smoke pending |

### Profile Care/Public navigation split — 2026-08-24

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Surface navigation | Profile Care no longer exposes or reopens the Profile Public card workspace through sidebar, query or legacy hash navigation. Profile Public keeps its direct card/portfolio workspace. | Implemented locally; browser smoke pending |
| Boundary | This is a presentation/navigation split only; backend REST ownership remains shared and server-side entitlement is still pending. | Documented |

### Profile publish-time public-safe capability snapshot — 2026-08-23

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Publish boundary | Profile publish now writes a server-generated `publicGraphSnapshot` into the existing `profile-card.props`, containing only approved capability fields and a content hash. | Implemented locally; WordPress publish smoke pending |
| Public renderer | Page Builder prefers the published snapshot and preserves `publicCapabilities` fallback for legacy cards. No private KG, memory or CRM query was added to public rendering. | Implemented locally; public browser smoke pending |
| Snapshot freshness | Editing `publicCapabilities` removes the old snapshot from shared SiteConfig; the next publish regenerates it from the current owner-approved capabilities. | Implemented locally; republish smoke pending |

### Profile Public WebChat to canonical CRM — 2026-08-23

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CRM projection | Profile Public WebChat inbound now reuses the canonical CRM WebChat adapter and ingestor; owner projection also includes `profile_webchat_{card_id}_*` sessions. | Implemented locally; WordPress runtime smoke pending |
| Single responder | Profile temporarily vetoes CRM AI auto-reply while ingesting the inbound turn, then mirrors the successful TwinBrain answer into the CRM conversation without a second channel send. | Implemented locally; duplicate-reply smoke pending |
| Provenance | Pipeline lead source preserves `webchat` instead of classifying Profile WebChat as `zalo_oa`; CRM message IDs are stable for idempotent inserts. | Implemented locally |

### Profile detailed metrics and chat transcript — 2026-08-23

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard metrics | Added separate views, Tel, Email, Facebook, chat-open, successful-chat and contact metrics to per-card and aggregate Profile dashboards. | Implemented locally; public/runtime smoke pending |
| Chat content | Added owner-scoped `/profile/cards/{id}/chat-transcript`, persisting Profile WebChat user questions and Twin answers in canonical `bizcity_webchat_messages` under `profile_webchat_{card_id}_*`. | Implemented locally; WebChat/CRM runtime smoke pending |
| Cache compatibility | Versioned Profile analytics report cache to `report_v2` so old cached payloads without `metrics` cannot mask the new REST contract. | Implemented locally |

### Profile metrics and chat transcript — 2026-08-23

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Metrics | Profile analytics now returns and renders separate counts for views, Tel, Email, Facebook, chat opens, successful chat questions, and submitted contacts in both per-card and aggregate dashboards. | Implemented locally; public/runtime smoke pending |
| Transcript | Successful Profile WebChat turns persist user questions and Twin answers in canonical `bizcity_webchat_messages` under a card-scoped session prefix; owner-scoped read-only transcript REST/UI was added. | Implemented locally; WordPress CRM/WebChat runtime smoke pending |
| Privacy boundary | Daily Profile JSONL remains redacted event evidence only; raw chat content is kept in WebChat canonical storage and is never copied into traffic logs. | Implemented locally |

### Profile Public runtime UX and observability — 2026-08-23

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Brain hero | Added a deterministic visible Brain visualization behind the canvas animation and a legacy `profileCardId` resolver from published page to Profile registry, preventing `card_id=0` from disabling chat/tracking/vCard. | Implemented locally; public browser smoke pending |
| Ordering | Added native drag-and-drop ordering for public contact links and social links; order persists in the shared Page Builder SiteConfig. | Implemented locally; Profile UI build PASS |
| Traffic | Mirrored accepted Profile events into the canonical daily `profile` JSONL channel log and added owner/card/date-filtered log REST reads in analytics. | Implemented locally; WordPress runtime log read pending |
| Twin GPT menus | Split the server app catalog into `My card QR` and `My profile`, with deep-link support for Profile Public/Care while preserving the legacy `profile` ID. | Implemented locally; Twin GPT UI build PASS |
| Notebook detail | Remounted the page editor after detail fetch so API-provided title/content is displayed; documented SQL metadata/index versus `.md` content ownership. | Implemented locally; Profile UI build PASS |
| Legacy card recovery | Page Builder now passes its known published `post_id` into Profile rendering, making `profileCardId` recovery deterministic even when query context is unavailable. | Implemented locally; public browser smoke pending |
| Analytics contract | Added the missing `funnel` field to Profile analytics REST responses and ensured the resolved card ID is applied before rendering the public Profile tab. | Implemented locally; public browser smoke pending |

### Zalo Personal native self-echo and Personal-only scope — 2026-08-23

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Personal ownership | `bizcity-zalo-personal` bootstrap/probe now owns Personal only; OA is not loaded or required by this module. | Implemented locally; deploy + rerun Diagnostics |
| Native Zalo messages | Sidecar preserves `threadId`, records WP-only outbound provider IDs, and marks `origin=crm` versus `origin=native_zalo`; native messages mirror into CRM as outgoing agent rows. | Implemented locally; production smoke pending |
| CRM resolver | Added the missing WordPress DB handle in `BizCity_CRM_Guru_Resolver` before binding/notebook queries. | Implemented locally; production log verification pending |
| Probe semantics | Domain-deny fixtures now allow entitlement to remain true; Personal probe no longer fails because OA is owned elsewhere. | Implemented locally; WordPress Diagnostics rerun pending |

### Managed Zalo entitlement capacity repair — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Root-cause trace | Confirmed the failing key can be `master_premium` with `bizcity-zalo-personal` enabled while `zalo_personal_account_limit=0`; Branch 19 correctly fails closed on the independent capacity gate. | Verified from production response for key `4474` |
| Hub migration | Bumped Master Plan schema migration to `2.6.2`; built-in managed Zalo defaults are now Free `1`, Pro `3`, Premium `-1` (unlimited), with the feature enabled in all three plans. | Implemented locally; deploy and rerun `/master/config` |
| Admin save safety | Legacy Master Plan submissions that omit the Zalo capacity field now preserve the stored value instead of silently writing `0`. | Implemented locally |
| Error reason clarity | Exact-key Zalo capability now distinguishes `account_capacity_disabled` from `feature_not_enabled`; client UI explains that the plugin is enabled but the account capacity is zero. | Implemented locally |
| Client capability freshness | Zalo Personal UI now prefers the latest `/zalo-bridge/health` capability over stale cached settings capability, so `allowed=true/account_limit=-1` can enable account creation immediately. | Implemented locally; deploy rebuilt Channel Gateway bundle |
| Acceptance gate | Added roadmap/API documentation requiring exact-key `channels.zalo_personal` verification after migration. | Documented; runtime evidence pending |

### Managed Zalo create UX and trace — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Sheet lifecycle | Save/create sheets close only after `ok=true`, show global success/error toast, and refresh account/health state after account creation. | Implemented locally; deploy rebuilt Channel Gateway bundle |
| Create trace | Added redacted `[BIZCITY_ZCA_TRACE]` milestones for auth, Hub response, sidecar account, mapping schema/save, CRM inbox upsert, and completion. | Implemented locally; inspect PHP/file channel logs after the next create attempt |
| Error response | Client Zalo REST proxy now preserves `code`, `message`, `hint`, and `help_code` instead of returning a blank degraded message. | Implemented locally |

### Managed Zalo default seat policy — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Product policy | Managed Zalo Personal is enabled by default for Free, Pro and Premium; account seats are `1 / 3 / -1 unlimited`. | Implemented in Hub seed/migration and documented across Hub/client/plugin contracts |
| Zero-capacity semantics | `0` remains an explicit lock; `reason=account_capacity_disabled` distinguishes it from a missing feature slug. | Implemented locally |

### Managed Zalo create domain-gate trace — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Exact-key diagnosis | Confirmed production create for `mrodemo.btnet.vn` authenticates as Hub API key `#59`; the request stops at `allowed_domain` before any sidecar call. | Verified from `invalid_metadata` response |
| Redacted trace | Hub now records `domain_gate` with key id, domain presence, host hashes and match booleans; client forwards safe correlation fields without raw domain or credential. | Implemented locally; deploy and retry once |
| Repair path | Existing-key Master Admin now provides a sanitized hostname editor; set key `#59` to the real client hostname, then retry account creation. | Implemented locally; production parse-error artifact must be replaced |

### API-key revoke diagnostics — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Revoke backend | Key revoke now verifies the exact row is active, checks the database update result, reads back `is_active=0`, and logs redacted `revoke_start/update/complete` stages. | Implemented locally |
| Revoke UI | HTTP `403`/AJAX failures now show an error and re-enable the button instead of failing silently after the confirm dialog. | Implemented locally; deploy Master Admin artifact |
| Domain contract | Documented `invalid_metadata` as exact-key `allowed_domain` failure with safe `key_id/domain_set/host_hash` correlation. | Documented |

### Master Admin script-loader fix — 2026-08-22

| Area | Root cause / change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| JavaScript boot | Master page was loading API Monitor's `admin-monitor.js`, which expects `BizMonitor`; this caused `BizMonitor is not defined` and prevented admin handlers from running. | Fixed locally; deploy Master Admin artifact |
| Inline config | `BizMaster` is now defined before the Master page's inline key/plan handlers execute; jQuery is explicitly enqueued. | Fixed locally |
| Revoke interaction | Revoke buttons are explicit `type="button"` controls and use AJAX error handling with DB read-back verification. | Fixed locally |

### Production verification: Managed Zalo provisioning — 2026-08-22

| Area | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Exact-key entitlement | Client production received Premium `channels.zalo_personal.allowed=true` with `account_limit=-1`. | User-confirmed production verification |
| Domain gate | API key `#59` was assigned the client hostname and the create request passed `allowed_domain`. | User-confirmed production verification |
| Account provisioning | Managed Zalo account creation proceeded after entitlement and domain repairs. | User-confirmed production verification |
| Remaining gate | QR login, managed inbound callback, outbound delivery, restart recovery and two-key isolation still need separate evidence. | Pending |

### B2B2C trace-first framework and Zalo UI consolidation — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Framework rule | Added a reusable preflight route matrix across Copilot instructions, R-B2B2C, Framework Guide, contract testing/runtime, Plugin Standard, Hub API and client/module contracts. | Implemented and validated locally |
| Failure classification | Standardized transport/auth/entitlement/domain/tenant/mapping/side-effect/presentation-cache classification with success and denial evidence requirements. | Documented |
| UI ownership | Merged Zalo Personal Guru controls and account list into one Overview Card; Guru panel supports embedded rendering and no longer owns a duplicate card. | Implemented locally; Channel Gateway build PASS |

### Phase 0.39C production-closure roadmap — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Roadmap | Created `PHASE-0.39C-ZALO-PERSONAL-PRODUCTION-CLOSURE-ROADMAP.md` with ordered C0-C7 slices, route trace matrix, denial matrix, code anchors and release checklist. | Active roadmap |
| Remaining gates | QR/restart recovery, managed inbound callback, CRM outbound, two-key isolation, `/gpt/` member smoke and archive/DDV production evidence are explicitly separated from already verified entitlement/domain/account-create work. | Pending by wave |

### Phase 0.39C C0 contract fixtures — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Public contract | Registered `zalo-personal-bridge` v1 in `core/twin-core` contract catalog with schema, allowed/denied/mapping fixture matrix and invalid fixture. | Implemented locally; Node suite PASS with 14 contracts |
| Diagnostics | Extended `modules.zalo-personal` with Disk/Loader/Runtime semantics for exact key, domain, entitlement, side effect and mapping outcomes without network calls. | Implemented locally; WordPress runtime PASS pending |
| Next wave | C1 is now the active coding slice: managed QR, status transitions and restart/expiry recovery. | Ready to implement |

### B1/B2/C Master Plan entitlement contract — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Hub plan catalog | Added the canonical `BizCity_LLM_Client::get_master_plans()` wrapper and made the same-origin Wallet proxy preserve `member_seats`, `channels.zalo_personal`, and `zalo_personal_account_limit`. | Implemented locally; deploy and verify `/bizcity-channel/v1/master/plans` |
| Exact-key entitlement | The current-plan proxy now resolves through `get_plan_config()` with `allow_main_site_fallback=false`; local user meta is no longer used as a Hub plan identity. | Implemented locally; deploy and verify current-blog key scope |
| Framework contract | Documented B1 Hub exact-key ceiling → B2 tenant projection/policy → C actor/member policy, explicitly separating public plan catalog from runtime authorization. | Documented in B2B2C and Membership contracts |

### TBP-6.3 Profile Zalo Personal owner picker — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Profile REST | Added `platform=zalo_personal` account projection from `BizCity_Zalo_Mapping_Repo::list_personal_accounts_for_owner()`, filtering to the current owner's connected accounts with a usable Zalo UID. | Implemented locally; live bridge/CRM ownership smoke pending |
| Profile UI | Added the owner-scoped Zalo Personal selector to Entrypoints and dedicated public CTA labeling. | Implemented locally; Profile UI build PASS |
| Loader/DDV | Loaded Zalo Personal mapping on Profile Care/Public editor routes and extended the Profile Wave 6.2 probe with picker contract evidence. | Implemented locally; WordPress probe rerun required |
| Save boundary | Enabled Zalo Personal entrypoints now require a fallback URL derived from a connected account owned by the current Profile owner; arbitrary manually submitted URLs are rejected. | Implemented locally; live ownership/CRM smoke pending |

### Diagnostics phase groups and stale-deploy hardening — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Curated phase groups | Added P0 foundation, B1 entitlement, B2 isolation, C Twin GPT CRM and W8 archive `Run group` shortcuts in Diagnostics. | Implemented locally; run on authenticated WordPress Diagnostics |
| Zalo managed compatibility | Added the missing Hub client singleton and guarded every managed bridge callsite so stale deployments degrade instead of throwing `undefined method ...::instance()`. | Implemented locally; deploy and rerun `modules.zalo-personal` |
| Schema inventory | Reconciled `modules.twin-crm.json` automation-rules catalog v1.28.1 with the active CRM installer (`created_by_id`, `inbox_id`, `last_run_at`, `idx_event_active`, `idx_inbox`). | Implemented locally; deploy and rerun `schema.inventory` |
| Probe runtime fixes | Corrected Zalo Personal probe to use `Integration_Registry::get()`, loaded the existing `core.channel.zone_ui` probe in Diagnostics bootstrap, and synchronized the Personal probe's 35-row metadata. | Implemented locally; deploy and rerun P0/B1/B2/W8 groups |

### Managed Zalo health contract — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Health boundary | Added `BizCity_Zalo_Bridge_Client::health()` for managed Hub and custom sidecar modes; REST now normalizes `success/ok` and degrades safely when a mixed-version client lacks the method. | Implemented locally; deploy both Bridge Client and REST, then rerun the Zalo Personal probe |

### Profile roadmap and next wave — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime evidence | Recorded that `modules.personal.profile`, `modules.personal.profile.wave5`, and `modules.personal.profile.wave62` each passed on WordPress runtime; the curated `profile` group remains pending aggregate execution. | Individual probes PASS; group run pending |
| TBP-6 | Defined the next wave for Profile Public channel funnel and ownership: five channels converge on canonical CRM, Zalo Personal account ownership is verified server-side, Profile Care/Public navigation is separated while BE remains shared, and public Brain rendering observes publish-time privacy/performance boundaries. | Roadmap defined; implementation pending |

### Profile Diagnostics group — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Curated probe group | Added the `profile` Diagnostics quick-run group, covering `modules.personal.profile`, `modules.personal.profile.wave5`, and `modules.personal.profile.wave62` while preserving each probe's individual evidence and cleanup behavior. | Implemented locally; run the group on the WordPress Diagnostics page |

### Managed Zalo Personal B2B2C enforcement — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| B1 Hub entitlement | Master Plan migration repairs existing Pro rows with the canonical `bizcity-zalo-personal` feature and exposes exact-key account capacity through Branch 19. | Implemented locally; Hub migration and two-key runtime smoke required |
| B2 tenant isolation | Managed client calls use the current blog's API key without main-site fallback; Hub callback registration requires an exact key domain and caches account counts by physical Hub database plus `key_id`. | Implemented locally; multi-client callback smoke required |
| C Twin GPT | `/gpt/` Personal account routes require the managed Hub capability before list/create/QR/status/delete, reject guests/custom bridge mode, and create accounts through an explicit `owner_user_id` service boundary. | Implemented locally; member/guest/denied browser smoke required |
| Ownership review fixes | QR/status/delete no longer delegate to admin-only handlers; the owner service verifies `kind=personal`, and the Personal route cannot be repurposed to create a Zalo OA account. | Implemented locally |
| Legacy tenant migration | Mapping migration v1.1.4 backfills `owner_user_id` from legacy `user_id` and `account_name` from `label` so existing accounts remain visible under owner-scoped `/gpt/` queries. | Implemented locally; tenant migration smoke required |
| Callback transport security | Managed Branch 19 rejects non-HTTPS callback URLs before registering account-specific bearer credentials. | Implemented locally |
| Capacity concurrency | Branch 19 serializes provisioning per exact API key and invalidates the entitlement count after create/delete. | Implemented locally; concurrent quota smoke required |
| Conversation archive | The encrypted append-only CRM archive now uses one channel-aware pipeline for both `zalo_personal` and `messenger`, including a channel contract diagnostic row. | Implemented locally; Messenger event and archive smoke required |
| Archive safety bound | Archive JSONL rows are rejected above 256 KiB before filesystem append and emit a redacted operational failure event. | Implemented locally |
| Archive lifecycle | Added 365-day monthly retention through the existing guarded retention job, authorization-scoped encrypted export, legal-hold-aware atomic conversation erase, and bounded read-only partition reconciliation. | Implemented locally; production policy and smoke required |
| Archive integrity | Export and reconciliation now verify `blog_id`, channel, account HMAC, and peer HMAC against the requested partition before accepting an archive row. | Implemented locally |
| Archive maintenance boundary | Added admin-only same-origin `bizcity-channel/v1/conversation-archive/{reconcile,export,erase}` routes scoped to the current tenant; Inbox never calls these endpoints. | Implemented locally; production authorization smoke required |
| Twin GPT Personal CRM | Added same-origin Personal CRM list/detail/messages routes and a read-only Inbox panel in My Channels, reusing tenant CRM SQL and owner/inbox ACLs. | Implemented locally; authenticated browser smoke required |
| Twin GPT Personal CRM send | Added owner/inbox-scoped Personal send route and composer delegating to canonical CRM `post_message()` and channel adapter delivery path. | Implemented locally; authenticated Zalo Personal outbound smoke required |
| Twin GPT Personal send safety | Personal CRM history remains readable after logout, while outbound is restricted to connected Personal accounts only. | Implemented locally |

### Zalo Personal admin control plane — 2026-08-22

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| QR/account state | Zalo Personal QR success now refreshes the account list so `connected` is reflected immediately instead of leaving the row at `pending_qr`. | Implemented locally; deploy + browser smoke required |
| Guru binding | Channel Gateway now exposes per-account Zalo Personal Guru binding using the canonical `ZALO_PERSONAL` binding registry. | Implemented locally; runtime binding smoke required |
| Twin Brain reply switch | Added explicit `Bật trả lời` / `Tắt trả lời` control backed by the existing binding `mode` + `auto_reply` contract. New Zalo Personal bindings default to `manual/OFF`; OFF keeps CRM Inbox ingestion and disables automatic Guru reply. | Implemented locally; runtime send/skip smoke required |
| Guru Quick Edit | Personal accounts can open the shared Guru Quick Edit surface for system prompt, runtime, Quick Training, notebook attach/detach, and source-to-notebook bridge. | Implemented locally; deploy + browser smoke required |
| CRM Inbox progress | Recorded the live admin evidence: connected Personal account and inbound contact/conversation/message visible in BizCity Twin CRM Inbox BE. | Verified on admin BE; outbound/access policy evidence remains pending |
| Auto-reply enforcement | CRM AI Autoreply Listener now fails closed for `zalo_personal` unless an exact Guru binding has `auto_reply=1`; the previous global default could call Chat Gateway even when the Personal UI showed OFF. | Fixed locally; deploy + OFF/ON live smoke required |
| Legacy Zalo channel cleanup | Added a dedicated `DELETE /bizcity-crm/v1/inboxes/{id}/zalo-legacy` route and CRM Inbox rail action. It only purges `zalo_personal` inboxes with no local managed-account mapping; active managed channels are protected. | Implemented locally; deploy + legacy/managed deletion smoke required |
| QR/session recovery | QR login now validates Personal account type, prevents duplicate in-flight login, persists terminal expiry, resumes an existing QR, and marks connected accounts with missing credentials as expired on restart. | Implemented locally; deploy + restart/QR smoke required |
| CRM Zalo flow diagnostic | Added read-only `GET /bizcity-crm/v1/inboxes/{id}/zalo-diagnostic` and a per-inbox `Kiểm tra flow` action. It checks CRM inbox, adapter, account mapping, Client/Hub bridge health and recent inbound/outbound evidence without sending a message. | Implemented locally; deploy + browser flow smoke required |

### Diagnostics CI mock-mode stabilization — 2026-08-21

| Area | Root cause / change | Status | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| CLI schema orchestration | `bin/diagnostics-run.php` now calls `BizCity_Site_Provisioner::run_all( true )` (registering default installers first) right after `init`, instead of relying on `admin_init`/activation-hook lifecycle that a headless CLI request never triggers. This is the root fix for the CI "table_missing" cascade (`schema.inventory`, `core.automation`, `channel-gateway.fb-publisher`, `scheduler.automation`, `scheduler.nerve_center`, `scheduler.inbound_backfill`, `core.memory.unified_dual-write-parity`, etc.), all of which share the same underlying cause: bundled/library schemas that only install via `register_activation_hook()` or `admin_init` never ran in the mock-mode job. | Implemented locally; CI rerun required to confirm the cascade clears | Any new schema installer must register with the `bizcity_register_installers` filter (Site Provisioner), not rely solely on `register_activation_hook()`/`admin_init`, so headless CI and multisite new-blog provisioning both pick it up. |
| CLI failure evidence | `bin/diagnostics-run.php` now prints each probe's `summary`/`error` detail (truncated) inline in the console/JUnit output instead of only badge + id, so CI logs are actionable without re-running locally. | Implemented locally | — |
| R-DDV-MOCK-GATEWAY probe skip pattern | Added `BIZCITY_DIAGNOSTICS_MOCK` skip guards to probes that make a real Search/LLM/embedding/Graph-API call and cannot be asserted without live credentials: `account.quota_entitlement`, `kg.filestore.standalone`, `kg.upload_attach_source`, `twinbrain.memory.writer.llm`, `twinbrain.sheet.enrich`, `twinbrain.web.gov`, `twinbrain.web.law`, `twinbrain.web.med`, `twinbrain.web.nutri`, `twinbrain.web.scholar`, `twinbrain.web.tax`, `web.deep_llm`, `web.search_ping` (plus the pre-existing `twinbrain.agent.react` / `twinbrain.brain.auto-degrade` guards from 2026-08-20). These probes now report SKIP in `--skip-network` CI runs instead of a misleading FAIL. | Implemented locally; CI rerun required | New real-call probes must add this guard in `precondition()` before any network/LLM/embedding call, matching the sibling `twinbrain.web.*` probes. |
| R-DDV-MOCK-GATEWAY — remaining gaps closed | Added the same guard to `twin.final.compose` (Final Composer streams a real LLM call) and `kg.graph.rag.ask` (embeds question, LLM rerank, LLM answer generation) — both were missing the guard even though every sibling live-gateway probe already had it. | Fixed locally; CI rerun required | — |
| Zalo Bot schema never provisioned headlessly | `plugins/bizcity-zalo-bot` is `require_once`'d by `bizcity-twin-ai.php` as a bundled sub-plugin, so its own `register_activation_hook( BIZCITY_ZALO_BOT_FILE, ... )` never fires (WordPress only calls activation hooks for plugins passed to `activate_plugin()`); its only other install path was `admin_init`, which a headless CLI request never triggers either. This is why `schema.inventory` reported `bizcity_zalo_bots` as critical-missing right after that table was catalogued as critical today. Registered `BizCity_Zalo_Bot_Plugin::maybe_create_tables()` with the `bizcity_register_installers` filter so Site Provisioner (CLI diagnostics, multisite new-blog, admin self-heal) provisions it independently of activation/admin_init. | Fixed locally; CI rerun required | Any bundled sub-plugin (`plugins/*` required by the parent instead of separately activated) must register its installer with Site Provisioner; its own `register_activation_hook()` is dead code in that topology. |
| Proprietary plugin folders missing from `.gitignore` | `.gitignore` had descriptive comments stating `bizcoach-pro` and `bizcity-twin-crm` are "in-house"/"proprietary, do NOT publish", but the actual ignore patterns (`/plugins/bizcoach-pro/`, `/plugins/bizcity-twin-crm/`) were absent, so a `git add .` on this workspace could commit proprietary commercial code to the public OSS repo. Added the missing patterns. | Fixed locally | If a plugin folder is documented as proprietary/in-house in `.gitignore` comments or in `bizcity-twin-ai.php`'s bundled-loader comments, verify the actual ignore pattern exists in the same PR — a comment alone does not exclude the path. **Follow-up required:** run `git status`/`git log -- plugins/bizcoach-pro plugins/bizcity-twin-crm` to confirm neither was already committed to the public remote; if either was, it must be purged from history, not just gitignored going forward. |



| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Vite assets | Profile UI now emits stable `assets/profile.js` and `assets/profile.css` files instead of hash-named bundles; the PHP runtime adds a `time()` cache version in local/development mode and preserves the stable plugin version in production. | Implemented locally; rebuild and browser smoke required |

### Twin GPT Profile and Workflow navigation — 2026-08-20

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Profile app path | Twin AI now must-loads the physical `bizcity-profile` bundle, exposes `My Profiles`, and serves the Profile SPA at `/profile/`; `/personal/` remains a compatibility alias. | Implemented locally; route and browser smoke required |
| My Workflows | Removed the false `OFF` state caused by surface-gated Automation classes, lazy-loads Automation for workflow API calls, and routes customer users to channel preflight plus the real ON/OFF controls. | Implemented locally; channel activation smoke required |

### BizCity Profile REST foundation — 2026-08-20

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| REST namespace | Canonicalized the Personal/Profile REST API to `bizcity-profile/v1`; PHP class names, storage tables, shortcode, and `/personal/` page path remain compatibility identifiers. | Implemented locally; deploy and route smoke required |
| Multisite POST guard | Added `bizcity-profile/v1` to the `bizgpt-multisite.php` route registry and POST bypass, including normalized `rest_route` and URI fallback handling. | Implemented locally; multisite smoke required |
| Profile schema | Added and implemented the R-DCL entry for Profile card, QR style, and analytics event tables under `modules.personal` schema version 1.5.0. | Implemented locally; provisioning and Diagnostics evidence required |
| Page Builder bridge | Profile card publish now delegates to `bzpb/v1/publish` with trace/idempotency headers and updates the Profile registry only after BZPB success. | Implemented locally; publish smoke required |
| Channel context | Added published-card/entrypoint validation and short-lived `WEBCHAT`/`TWINWEB` context resolution through `BizCity_Channel_Binding`; no browser-supplied Guru ID or provider credential is exposed. | Implemented locally; channel binding smoke required |
| Entrypoint configuration | Added owner-scoped `GET/PUT /profile/cards/{id}/entrypoints`, Page Builder SiteConfig persistence with mutation headers, and a clean Profile UI panel for channel toggles, WebChat presentation, and tracking tags. | Implemented locally; save/binding smoke required |

### TwinBrain MPR V5.9 Media HIL interaction slice — 2026-08-19

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| HIL media runtime | `BizCity_TwinBrain_HIL_Runtime` now supports explicit `chọn ảnh khác` for media slots, keeps the same pending slot on that branch, and returns candidate-aware prompts (no-candidate upload guidance vs indexed selection guidance). | Fixed locally; deploy + Diagnostics rerun required |
| HIL progress notice | `BizCity_TwinBrain_Progress_Notice_Projector::on_hil_step()` now emits `hil_evidence_candidate_found` when scoped media candidates exist, then keeps waiting guidance user-safe without exposing raw URLs/tokens. | Fixed locally; deploy + canary evidence required |
| HIL synthetic DDV | `twinbrain.hil` fixture now verifies `select-other keeps pending slot` and `missing candidate asks for upload` contracts for media slots. | Fixed locally; rerun required |

### TwinBrain MPR V5.10 Intent compatibility migration slice — 2026-08-19

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Intent compatibility adapter | Added `core/twinbrain/includes/class-twinbrain-intent-compat-adapter.php` to expose deterministic Slot Analysis / Clarify Gate / Confirm Analyzer / Memory Spec compatibility fields from Prompt Intent + Goal context, without provider calls or dual-write Goal truth. | Fixed locally; deploy + Diagnostics rerun required |
| Runtime decision stage | `BizCity_TwinBrain_Runtime::start_turn()` now emits `decision.stage=intent_compat_ready` and returns `intent_compat` envelope for migration surfaces. | Fixed locally; deploy + event evidence required |
| TwinChat surface migration | TwinChat stream pipeline now forwards `prompt_intent` + `intent_compat` into completion opts and emits SSE `decision.stage=intent_compat_ready` with compact compatibility telemetry (`clarify_needed`, `slot_missing_count`, `confirm_intent`, `memory_scope`) for timeline observability. | Fixed locally; deploy + timeline/event evidence required |
| Zalo workflow migration | `llm.mpr_think` action output now carries `prompt_intent` + `intent_compat`; compact per-event summaries retain compatibility keys so Zalo workflow traces can audit migration state without leaking raw payloads. | Fixed locally; deploy + workflow evidence required |
| Automation bridge migration | `BizCity_Automation_TwinBrain_Bridge::run_with_capture()` and `action.ask_guru` now preserve Prompt Intent/Intent Compat (plus related triage/context fields) across `complete_turn`, preventing contract loss between start and completion phases. | Fixed locally; deploy + workflow evidence required |
| Legacy pending read window | HIL payload preparation now accepts legacy `_resume.attachment_url` / `attachment_url` / `media_url` fallback when canonical `attachments[]` is absent. | Fixed locally; deploy + canary verification required |
| V5 product-match gate | HIL product matching defaults to deterministic mode; optional LLM matcher is now explicit opt-in via filter `bizcity_twinbrain_v5_allow_llm_product_match`. | Fixed locally; deploy + behavior verification required |
| Aggregate DDV | `twinbrain.mpr_v5` now checks the V5.10 compatibility adapter, deterministic fixture contract, and disk-level surface wiring markers for TwinChat/Zalo/Automation bridge migration. | Fixed locally; rerun required |

### TwinBrain MPR V5 Gate 6 outbound evidence hardening — 2026-08-19

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Live canary surfaces | `POST /wp-json/bizcity-diagnostics/v1/smoke/run-live` now supports explicit surface routing: `zalo_bot` (legacy default) and `twinchat` (new). The aggregate probe `twinbrain.mpr_v5` dispatches live execution by `live_surface`, preserving existing Zalo linked-identity contract while adding TwinChat runtime trace/stage evidence capture. | Fixed locally; deploy + live evidence required |
| Live canary run options | Added `GET /wp-json/bizcity-diagnostics/v1/smoke/run-live/options` to return required fields, payload templates, REST endpoint metadata, and WP-CLI fallback command snippets for `twinchat` and `zalo_bot` surfaces. | Fixed locally; deploy + usage verification required |
| Windows execution helper | The live-canary options response now includes PowerShell `Invoke-RestMethod` snippets with JSON bodies for both surfaces. Auth values remain explicit placeholders for the current admin REST nonce/session cookie and are never persisted as evidence. | Fixed locally; deploy + usage verification required |
| Channel Gateway outbound evidence | `BizCity_Gateway_Sender` now publishes explicit `idempotency_key` metadata alongside `side_effect_status` and `provider_request_id` in `bizcity_channel_outbound_logged` payloads for both adapter and legacy send paths. This aligns with Gate 6 aggregate disk checks and live-canary evidence capture requirements. | Fixed locally; deploy + OPcache refresh + probe rerun required |
| Goal Contract probe version gate | `twinbrain.goal_contracts` no longer requires strict `current_version === DB_VERSION` for `core.twinbrain.json`. The probe now accepts `current_version >= DB_VERSION` so module-level changelog bumps (for taxonomy/non-DDL rows) do not false-fail the R-DCL table contract check. | Fixed locally; deploy + probe rerun required |
| MPR V5 roadmap/probe parity | Documented the Gate 6 marker fix in the MPR V5 roadmap as source-level closure for aggregate step-4 (`Gateway outbound idempotency evidence`) while keeping §21 DoD checkboxes unchanged until synthetic rerun and live canary evidence pass. | Updated locally |

### TwinChat Woo BizOps direct vertical path — 2026-08-16

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| TwinBrain runtime | `web_mode=woo_bizops` now skips generic Notebook Selector and Tool Intent stages; Woo is treated as a direct Vertical Plugin and still uses Final Composer for presentation. | Fixed locally; tenant rerun required |
| Woo order list | Added bounded `order_list` intent using HPOS-aware `wc_get_orders()` with structured `orders[]`, date range, status, total and citations. | Fixed locally; tenant rerun required |
| TwinChat timeline | Added visible Woo domain/query/composed stages and order count handling for `woo_bizops_*` SSE events. | TwinChat build PASS |
| Automation picker | `#` overlay now says Automation Workflow, mutually exclusive picker overlays close on a new prefix, and Builder exposes `command_invokable` for workflow listing. | Automation/TwinChat builds PASS |

### Guru versus Vertical Plugin terminology — 2026-08-16

| Area | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Product vocabulary | Canonical split is now explicit: Guru = notebook/knowledge scope; `/vertical_slug` = Vertical Brain Mode / Plugin capability. `guru_id` and `BizCity_TwinBrain_Guru_Policy` remain compatibility identifiers only. | Documentation and user-facing error text updated |
| Woo BizOps policy messages | Replaced user-facing wording that implied Guru owns Woo BizOps access with `scope notebook` and `Vertical Plugin capability` wording. | Updated locally |

### Automation Diagnostics runtime evidence — 2026-08-16

| Area | Root cause / change | Status | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| Automation loader | Diagnostics loads the Automation surface before probe execution; Ask Guru uses the active `blocks/actions/` path. | Fixed locally; runtime evidence updated | Run `core.automation` on the canonical Diagnostics page after deploy and verify every required class, including Templates Seeder. |
| `automation.matcher` probe | Fixture carries linked owner identity, preserves top-level `raw_text` for `@` command tests, and invokes `extract_ref_uuid()` with its current `(payload, platform)` signature. | **Runtime PASS confirmed** | Synthetic channel payloads must satisfy R-ZONE/R-CH-IDMEM identity and normalized/raw text contracts. |
| `automation.crm_path` probe | CRM instantiate assertion unwraps canonical REST `{ ok, row }` response; Zalo OA/Bot fixtures include owner identity. | **Runtime PASS confirmed** | Probe assertions must consume the public REST DTO rather than assuming a flat row. |
| `twinbrain.notebook_depth` | Source map, W0.20 graph/retrieval/rerank pack, citation guard and depth profile contract pass on the tenant. | **Runtime PASS confirmed** | Keep notebook source-layer and final-composer profile expectations versioned together. |
| Templates Seeder visibility | Seeder remains intentionally lazy; the core Automation probe loads it only while that Diagnostics probe runs. | Fixed locally; rerun required | Do not load template seeding on unrelated admin, frontend or channel requests. |
| BE-7 builtin catalog count | The core Automation probe now runs an explicit idempotent `force_reseed()` before comparing builtin slugs, and reports failed slugs instead of accepting a partial catalog. | Fixed locally; rerun required | A partial builtin catalog must be repaired and measured before `core.automation` can PASS. |
| CCG-1 explicit command smoke | Extended the existing `core.automation` probe with an exact `#workflow_slug` + args resolve assertion in `zone=admin`, using a disposable command-invokable workflow and existing cleanup. | Fixed locally; rerun required | Keep explicit command DDV inside the tenant-visible core probe when the standalone command-zone probe is not exposed. |

### TwinChat Woo BizOps vertical dispatch — 2026-08-16

| Area | Root cause / change | Status | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/woo_bizops` dispatch | The generic `bizcity_twinbrain_web_mode_effective` Guru web-fallback gate converted `woo_bizops` to `off` before `dispatch_web_research()`, so TwinChat stayed in Notebook/MPR and never emitted `woo_bizops_*` events. Woo BizOps now passes that generic gate and is checked by its dedicated `BizCity_TwinBrain_Guru_Policy::CAP_WOO_BIZOPS` boundary. | Fixed locally; tenant rerun required | Do not apply the generic web-fallback flag to sensitive built-in verticals with their own capability policy. |

### BizCoach Pro F.9 diagnostics contract — 2026-08-16

| Area | Root cause / change | Status | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| `T-BCPRO.F9.a` Intent Provider class | The Diagnostics admin page is outside the normal Intent loader gate, so the read-only BizCoach matrix could evaluate `class_exists( 'BizCoach_Pro_Intent_Provider' )` before its base contract was available. The BizCoach probe now loads the Intent bootstrap/contract only during its precondition, then loads the lazy BizCoach provider. | **Runtime PASS confirmed** — F.9: 4 PASS · 0 FAIL · 0 WARN · 0 SKIP; matrix: 48 PASS · 12 WARN | Keep Diagnostics probes self-contained for the contracts they inspect; do not widen the global Intent preload gate for unrelated admin pages. |

### Diagnostics command-zone probe interface fatal — 2026-08-16

| Area | Root cause / change | Status | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core.twinbrain.command_zone` probe | The probe declared `private static cleanup(array $ids)`, conflicting with the required public non-static `BizCity_Diagnostics_Probe::cleanup(): void`. Renamed the health-test helper to `cleanup_workflows()` and added the interface-compliant cleanup method. | Fixed locally; production deploy required | Every new probe must be checked against `interface-diagnostics-probe.php` before lazy loading. |

### Automation diagnostics probe parse fatal — 2026-08-16

| Area | Root cause / change | Status | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core.automation` probe | Removed stray standalone action block strings that caused `unexpected ','` in `class-probe-automation.php`, and restored the missing `Repo_Runs::enqueue()` health-test step before runner execution. | Fixed locally; production deploy required | Run PHP syntax validation for every probe before deploy. A single malformed lazy-loaded probe can abort the entire Diagnostics catalog. |

### TwinChat shell KG-Hub menu fatal — 2026-08-13

| Area | Root cause / change | Status | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| Central admin menu | `includes/class-admin-menu.php` called `BizCity_KG_Admin_Menu::instance()` even on the TwinChat shell, where PHASE-1.26 intentionally loads only the lightweight Knowledge admin-menu class and not the KG-Hub runtime. Added a `class_exists()` guard; the full admin path remains registered by the KG-Hub bootstrap. | Fixed locally; production deploy required | Keep shell-only loader paths compatible with central menu callbacks. Run the admin-navigation probe on both the TwinChat shell and full Knowledge/KG-Hub admin surface. |

### Zalo Bot AI gateway unavailable — 2026-08-13

| Area | Root cause / change | Status | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zalo `/zalohook/` AI reply | The request gate loaded Knowledge/TwinBrain for `/zalohook/`, but both the main and compat LLM loader gates only recognized `/bizhook/`, `/wp-json/`, `/gpt`, and `/twin`. `BizCity_LLM_Client` was therefore absent, so the runtime misleadingly reported the gateway/API key as unavailable. Added `/zalohook/` to the main plugin and both compat loader copies. | Fixed locally; production deploy and OPcache refresh required | Keep main plugin, source compat, and deployed compat route matrices identical. Smoke-test `/zalohook/` for `BizCity_LLM_Client` before testing provider credentials. |
| Tenant Rolling Memory | Tenant `wp_1513_bizcity_memory_rolling` was missing `blog_id`/`identity_uuid` while the version option was already `1.4`. The version-only fast path allowed runtime SQL to reach the missing columns. Added physical-column verification and read/write guards. | Fixed locally; tenant migration still must be verified on `slave10` | A schema version option is not physical-shard evidence. Verify required columns on the routed tenant after deploy. |
| Zalo no-match reply | The automation matcher sent `BizCity_Automation_Default_Reply`, then legacy `twf_handle_chat_flow()` also sent a response. Disabled the automation default reply for Zalo Bot when the legacy responder is active. | Fixed locally; production deploy required | One channel/request must have one responder owner. Check send traces for duplicate `automation.default_reply` and legacy TWF sends. |
| Workflow continuity | Raw Zalo intake did not resolve the linked WordPress owner before enqueue, and `web_post` scheduler metadata lacked `web_content` in the stale production path. Added owner resolution and the required metadata field. | Fixed locally; production deploy required | Test owner/chat continuity and scheduler metadata on a real workflow run, not only static contracts. |
| Zalo `/link` and SSO binding | Automation slash matching could claim `/link <nonce>` before `BizCity_Zalobot_Command_Router`, while the CRM SSO return could lose `bzzalolink` before token consumption. Reserved `/link` at both matcher/router boundaries and added a short-lived return marker so an authenticated SSO return can consume the pending magic link. | Fixed locally; production deploy required | Treat identity-binding commands as system-reserved. `welcome=1` is only a UI redirect; verify the canonical channel mapping and `link_command_bound` evidence. |
| Magic-link ownership contract | Documented and locked ownership: `BizCity_CRM_Magic_Link` / `BizCity_CRM_Magic_Link_Handler` own issue, verify, consume and browser/SSO callback; `BizCity_Channel_User_Linker` owns canonical `ZALO_BOT` identity mapping; `BizCity_Zalobot_User_Linker` is compatibility-only during migration. Updated R-CH-UNI, CRM Phase 3.5, Zalo Admin Guide and identity/memory/notebook roadmaps. | Documentation updated 2026-08-13 | Do not add token issuance or callback handling back to a channel plugin. Validate both `consumed_at` and canonical `bizcity_channel_user_links` after login. |
| Legacy TWF retirement for Zalo Bot | Production evidence showed `bizgpt_chatbot_run_admin_flows()` still calling `twf_process_flow_from_params()` for `ZALO_BOT`, causing `/link <nonce>` to be classified by LLM and then handled as ordinary chat. Added hard-stop guards in the active MU adapter, bundled Zalo adapter, and `core/helper-legacy/legacy_flow-router.php`. | Fixed locally; production deploy required | A Zalo Bot request must not emit `ai_result user_text`, `ai_result json`, or legacy `twf_handle_chat_flow`; it must be handled by canonical UCL/Command Router/Automation only. |
| `/link` recovery and login status | `/link` nonce failures now inspect the current canonical identity first: an already-linked user is told the active WordPress account; an unlinked user receives a fresh CRM Magic Link instead of only an error message. The `đăng nhập` command reports the linked account or explicitly says no account is linked and sends a fresh link. | Fixed locally; production deploy required | Do not report `chưa đăng nhập` when `resolve_wp_user()` returns a user. Only unlinked identities receive a replacement URL. |

### R-PERF/R-CACHE audit ledger — 2026-08-09


| Area | Canonical record | Change / evidence | Status | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Active MU/plugin loader audit | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `PHASE-1.23-CANONICAL.md` W6.1 | Audited active MU entrypoints. Added narrow gates for the Network Admin/cron dashboard graph, frontend DB debug bar probes, domain-mapping schema repair, and the user-new handler. PHP 8.1.34 lint passed for all changed files; WordPress request-matrix and deployed parity are not yet evidence. | Implemented locally / runtime pending 2026-09-10 | Capture frontend, unrelated admin, Network Admin, user-new, cron and source/deployed loader traces before marking fixed. |
| Market bootstrap graph | `R-PERF-LOADER` §7.2 | Split public shortcode/catalog, storage and Woo payment contracts from admin/backup/restore/marketplace/schema artifacts. Guarded every selected artifact and booted admin/cron classes only on their owning contexts. PHP 8.1.34 lint PASS; runtime route and schema evidence pending. | Implemented locally / runtime pending 2026-09-10 | Validate shortcode, Woo payment, Network Admin, marketplace AJAX, backup/restore cron and unrelated frontend file/class deltas. |
| OpenRouter bootstrap graph | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-GW-8` | Kept OpenRouter/models/shortcodes/Woo account compatibility classes available while deferring provider, Hub REST, billing, key and settings classes to REST/admin/maintenance contexts. Callback registration now checks loaded artifacts. PHP 8.1.34 lint PASS; REST/admin/shortcode runtime evidence pending. | Implemented locally / runtime pending 2026-09-10 | Validate unrelated REST, Hub REST, Network Admin settings, Woo account endpoints, public shortcodes and gateway degraded behavior. |
| R2 duplicate worker precondition | `R-PERF-LOADER` §7.2 + `R-GW-8` | `MUCD_Files::r2_config_ok()` now requests the canonical lazy AWS SDK loader owned by `bizcity-r2.php` instead of requiring `Aws\\S3\\S3Client` to already exist. Worker errors distinguish missing R2 constants from `aws_sdk_missing`; source/deployed AJAX action parity remains pending. PHP 8.1.34 lint PASS. | Implemented locally / runtime pending 2026-09-10 | Rerun the same duplicate flow, inspect job message and loader trace, then verify one R2 object reaches the target prefix without a second autoloader. |
| Cumulative performance incident rule | `PHASE-0-RULE-PERFORMANCE-LOADER.md` §7.2 | Added a repeatable incident ledger contract: classify the first expensive owner and root-cause category, preserve before/after metrics, separate static/loader/runtime/production evidence, and record rollback boundaries. | Documentation updated 2026-09-10 | Append the next confirmed loader regression to the same rule, changelog and repository memory. |
| Safe Loader diff gate | `R-SAFE-LOADER` | Increased the aggregate Git diff buffer and added per-bootstrap diff fallback so a large diff does not produce exit 1 while the report has `new_violations: []` and `status: PASS`. | Fixed locally 2026-08-26 | Rerun the GitHub Actions public-contract job on the new SHA. |
| Bundled plugin activation boundary | `R-SAFE-LOADER` + `R-AUTO-MU` | Removed nested bundled-plugin injection into WordPress `get_plugins()`/`all_plugins`, added stale activation-entry cleanup, and made `bizcity-twin-compat.php` source/version drift auto-sync from `mu-plugin/`. | Fixed locally 2026-08-26 | Deploy both compat/main loader artifacts and verify a clean host lists only the top-level plugin; rerun Diagnostics on the deployed runtime. |
| Diagnostics probe lazy queue | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Removed an early `bizcity_diagnostics_load_probes_once()` flush from `core/diagnostics/bootstrap.php`; it could mark the loader complete before the remaining probe queue declarations were registered, leaving the Diagnostics catalog empty or incomplete. | Fixed locally 2026-08-16 | Deploy to the affected site and verify `GET /wp-json/bizcity-diagnostics/v1/smoke/probes` returns a non-empty catalog as an admin. |
| Canonical loader rule | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Codified PHASE-1.23 lessons: surface-scoped loading, pre-`plugins_loaded` evidence, compat/main/bundle parity, shell iframe isolation, file/class delta as primary signal, and QM A/B instrumentation. The observed shell gates reduced approximately 6 MB and are now mandatory guidance for new core/module/plugin loaders. | Fixed locally | Read `docs/rules/PHASE-0-RULE-PERFORMANCE-LOADER.md` before any loader/context-gate change. |
| PHASE-1.23 roadmap status | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Updated the root-cause document from analysis-only to implementation status: Wave 1–3 done locally, Wave 5 in progress, Wave 4 WooCommerce REST profiling next, and Wave 6 surface manifest/thin cron bridge planned. Added A/B, regression matrix and stop conditions. | Fixed locally | Establish deploy parity and route-level Woo evidence before shared-runtime changes. |
| PHASE-1.23 bundle root-cause dossier | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added a five-layer trace model (`entrypoint` -> `hook` -> `runtime` -> `data/provider` -> `coexistence`), evidence fields, verified code anchors, root-cause categories, and a per-group matrix for CRM/BizCoach, Intent, LLM, channels, tools, Dino plugins and MU files. | Fixed locally | Capture first include/parent callback and classify each row before writing further guards. |
| PHASE-1.23 continuity evaluation | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added a framework continuity scorecard (xuyen suot/ke thua/lien mach/no-recall/no-miss/no-broken-flow), Go/No-Go decision, invariants and pre-Wave-4 evidence gates. Declared route-level ownership trace as the next valid step and blocked broad guard expansion. | Fixed locally | Upgrade observability ownership fields (`callback_file`, `first_loaded_file`, `require_parent`) before route-level Woo/payment/channel refactor. |
| PHASE-1.23 loader risk deep review | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Distinguished duplicate file loading from duplicate hook/boot/state loading; documented main/compat/bundled/regular multi-owner paths; identified current collector blind spots and flow-break modes for OAuth, payment, webhook and cron; added PASS evidence gates. | Fixed locally | Add canonical boot state and causal trace fields before further context-gate changes. |
| PHASE-1.23 instrumentation and boot ownership spec | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added `docs/analysis/PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-INSTRUMENTATION-BOOT-OWNERSHIP-SPEC-2026-08-10.md`: observe-only instrumentation v2, monotonic boot states, canonical owner claims, duplicate registration evidence, bounded JSONL schema, migration phases and flow invariants. Explicitly excludes WooCommerce loader/payment changes. | Documentation complete | Implement Level A/B evidence first; keep ownership observe-only until deployment topology is proven. |
| PHASE-1.23 QM trace operating model | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added `docs/analysis/PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-QM-TRACE-PROBE-AUDIT-BA-TEST-2026-08-10.md`: QM limits, runtime/TwinCore/helper event layers, boot/hook/route/cron ownership, user-meta/cache semantics, probe catalog, PM/BA/audit/test/SRE responsibilities and acceptance matrix. WooCommerce remains observe-only external baseline. | Documentation complete | Implement observe-only QM/event/probe layer before any ownership enforcement or loader migration. |
| PHASE-1.23 CANONICAL roadmap | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Established `docs/roadmaps/PHASE-1.23-CANONICAL.md` as the single source of truth with scope boundary, canonical architecture, boot ownership, trace contract, W0-W7 code roadmap, cross-functional ownership, Definition of Done, stop conditions and release decisions. Marked the prior roadmap as supporting implementation notes. | Canonical established | Execute W1 observe-only QM instrumentation; do not change WooCommerce or enforce ownership before W1/W2 evidence passes. |
| PHASE-1.23 W1/W3 trace implementation | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Implemented local observe-only `bizcity.loader.v2` snapshots/export: callback file/line, bounded first/last file anchors, request context, all-callback source aggregation, registration delta and explicit unknown parent/boot-state fields. Added lazy Diagnostics probe `core.loader.trace_completeness`; no loader decision or WooCommerce code changed. | Implemented locally | Run Diagnostics/QM/JSONL A/B and deploy-parity validation before W2 ownership claims. |
| PHASE-1.23 W2 ownership observe-only | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added `BizCity_Loader_Ownership_Registry` with monotonic state, canonical path claims, secondary-owner/version conflict events and QM/probe visibility. Integrated `llm_client`, `knowledge`, `intent` and `twin_core` claims across main, source compat and deployed compat loaders; corrected registry sequencing before the first claim and record claim attempts even when `class_exists()` skips a require. No enforcement and no WooCommerce changes. | Implemented locally | Deploy parity and run main/compat/bundled/regular combination matrix before W2 PASS. |
| PHASE-1.23 W3 loader probes | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added lazy Diagnostics probes `core.loader.ownership` and `core.loader.registration_integrity` alongside `core.loader.trace_completeness`. They audit canonical owner/state, duplicate/conflicting claims, hook identity, available REST route identity and required cron schedules without changing runtime behavior. | Implemented locally | Run all three probes on Diagnostics/REST/CLI contexts; user-meta/cache probes remain planned. |
| PHASE-1.23 W4 TwinCore semantic trace | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added bounded parent-child runtime spans to `BizCity_Twin_Trace`, instrumented `Twin_Context_Resolver::build_prompt_bundle()`, and added lazy probe `twinbrain.runtime.continuity` for balanced enter/exit/open-span evidence. No DB/event-stream/provider writes and no payload logging. | Partial implemented locally | Extend one BizCity-owned boundary at a time across LLM, Knowledge, Memory, Composer, Scheduler and Channel Sender. |
| PHASE-1.23 W4 LLM boundary trace | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Instrumented `BizCity_LLM_Client::chat()` with one parent operation span and child spans for primary/fallback gateway attempts. Continuity probe now verifies parent existence and requires `chat_gateway` children to belong to `llm_client.chat`; fallback remains explicit rather than being misclassified as duplicate runtime. | Partial implemented locally | Validate one gateway request and one fallback/degraded request without logging prompts, keys or provider payloads. |
| PHASE-1.23 W4 streaming boundary trace | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Instrumented `BizCity_LLM_Client::chat_stream()` with primary/fallback `chat_stream_gateway` child spans and extended continuity assertions for blocking and streaming parent edges. No callback chunks, prompts or credentials are logged. | Partial implemented locally | Exercise blocking and streaming routes, then extend semantic spans to Memory/Knowledge one boundary at a time. |
| PHASE-1.23 W5 Memory Recall boundary trace | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Instrumented `BizCity_TwinBrain_Memory_Recall::collect()` with parent recall span and unified/legacy child spans, including hashed scope, tier/citation counts and explicit fallback path. Extended continuity probe to validate memory child edges without logging memory text or prompt content. | Partial implemented locally | Validate unified-enabled and legacy fallback requests; add user-meta/cache semantic wrappers next. |
| PHASE-1.23 W5 cache semantic trace | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added opt-in `BizCity_Cache` semantic spans for get/set/delete/flush_group with blog-scoped key signatures, hit/success and TTL buckets; added lazy `core.cache.trace_integrity` probe. Normal requests remain uninstrumented at cache-operation level and raw keys/values are never logged. | Partial implemented locally | Run forensic cache trace and correlate hit/miss/invalidation with QM DB/cache evidence; user-meta trace remains next. |
| PHASE-1.23 W5 user-meta semantic trace | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added forensic-only WordPress user-meta filters for get/update/add/delete with hashed user/key scope, key family, blog ID, caller file/line and short-circuit result; added lazy `core.user_meta.trace_integrity` probe. Filters are absent on ordinary requests and raw values are never logged. | Partial implemented locally | Run a forensic profile/login/memory request and classify repeated reads by business scenario. |
| PHASE-1.23 registration duplicate audit correction | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Screenshot review showed `dup:3/7` could conflate separate object instances sharing the same method. Registration keys now include request-local object/closure identity hashes; duplicate counts must be re-captured before being treated as real duplicate boot. | Fixed locally | Re-run the same QM request and compare identity-aware `dup` counts; keep Woo/external buckets as observed baseline only. |
| PHASE-1.23 loader screenshot metric correction | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Screenshot showed BizCity phase memory at 2 MB beside QM top-bar 49 MB. Snapshot/output now separates current, allocated and peak PHP memory; path normalization also handles relative/Windows/UNC paths before source-group classification. | Fixed locally | Re-capture the same request; compare current/peak columns with QM top-bar and confirm remaining `external/unknown` is genuinely external. |
| PHASE-1.23 instrumentation overhead correction | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Screenshot showed `+15.7 MB` to `+31.8 MB` capture deltas caused by the snapshot itself retaining callback rows/Reflection/source summaries. Renamed the metric to `capture_overhead_delta_kb`, switched default QM requests to summary mode, retained full detail only for Diagnostics or `?bizcity_qm_probe=1`, and kept runtime used/peak separate. | Fixed locally | Re-capture QM-only and explicit forensic requests; never use capture overhead as plugin phase memory. |
| PHASE-1.23 QM readiness gate | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added `memory_metric_consistent` evidence and explicit readiness policy: targeted BizCity fixes may proceed when duplicate/ownership evidence is clean; WooCommerce/Object Cache Pro/theme/external fixes remain separate workstreams. Diagnostics probe graph is not treated as normal shell baseline. | Fixed locally | Recapture after deploy/OPcache; start only owner-scoped BizCity fixes from clean evidence. |
| PHASE-1.23 runtime recapture blocker | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | QM now shows ownership parity (`CONTRACT_READY`, `conflicts=0`) and the canonical footer pair is valid (`85.55 / 85.55 MB`, `source: lifecycle_snapshot`). The remaining red state is now explicitly labeled `raw allocator mismatch`, separating PHP/OPcache evidence drift from the displayed canonical invariant. | Canonical display fixed / raw runtime evidence pending | Deploy hook panel, collector, HTML output, header output, registry and BizCoach entrypoint together; refresh OPcache/PHP-FPM; verify raw consistency is true before closing the gate. |
| PHASE-1.23 owner-track analysis roadmap | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added `docs/analysis/PHASE-1.23-BUNDLE-OWNER-FIX-ROADMAP-2026-08-10.md` with deep analysis for BizCoach, CRM, Intent, LLM, TwinCore/Knowledge/Memory, bundle/compat ownership, cache/user-meta and channel/OAuth/cron boundaries. Added mandatory pre-fix evidence, BA/audit/test gates and A0-A7 analysis roadmap. No runtime code changed. | Documentation complete | Use the seven-item readiness rule before any owner-scoped fix. |
| PHASE-1.23 BizCoach first lazy split | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Deferred `bizcoach-pro/includes/admin/class-astro-admin-form.php` from plugin file scope to `BizCoach_Pro_Astro_Admin_List::render_add_new()`. The class has no file-scope hook/route side effect; public routers, REST, cron and Intent provider paths remain unchanged. | Implemented locally | Validate Vedic/BaZi add-new submit plus normal admin/list/detail and bundled/regular ownership before the next BizCoach split. |
| PHASE-1.23 BizCoach bundled ownership claim | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added observe-only `bizcoach` claim/`CONTRACT_READY` transition at the bundled entrypoint, before shell guard and after stable constants. This records shell skip and real surface ownership without blocking or changing runtime loading. | Implemented locally | Recapture Boot ownership on shell, BizCoach admin and public/REST surfaces before enforcing or splitting more graph. |
| PHASE-1.23 BizCoach OPcache invalidation fix | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Removed per-request `opcache_invalidate()` for BizCoach Astro REST class. Kept `require_once` and explicit idempotent `init()`; stale bytecode is handled by deploy/maintenance OPcache refresh. No route, OAuth or provider behavior changed. | Implemented locally | Validate persona REST, public astrology/transit, normal admin and deploy OPcache procedure before next BizCoach split. |
| PHASE-1.23 BizCoach persona provider lazy split | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added `bcpro_load_persona_provider_classes()` and moved persona provider requires behind the provider filter, direct REST consumers and diagnostic F4/F6/F14 tasks. Provider IDs/source kinds remain unchanged; no new ownership path or Woo code changed. | Implemented locally | Validate provider catalog, coach-map REST, passage REST and BizCoach diagnostics before the next eager include split. |
| PHASE-1.23 BizCoach admin lifecycle splits | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Deferred `class-admin-coachees.php`, deprecated `class-astro-admin-settings.php`, and `class-astro-log-admin.php` from normal admin file scope. Menu registration stays on `admin_menu`; legacy Astro settings POST handlers and Astro log AJAX registration load only for their matching actions. No public, REST, cron or Intent contract was changed. | Implemented locally | Validate Coachees/Vedic/BaZi menus, legacy settings POST actions, Astro log AJAX, normal admin, bundled/regular ownership and fresh deploy parity. |
| PHASE-1.23 framework monitor evaluation | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added [framework monitor evaluation](docs/analysis/PHASE-1.23-FRAMEWORK-MONITOR-EVALUATION-2026-08-10.md) from the current QM/BizCity Loader capture. It separates ownership PASS, bounded registration evidence, Diagnostics contamination, external Woo/Flatsome baseline, raw memory evidence and the prioritized optimization framework/backlog. | Research complete / runtime gates open | Use the dossier to run surface-labeled A/B captures and route-level owner analysis; do not treat the Diagnostics request as a normal shell memory baseline. |
| PHASE-1.23 monitor severity/result UX | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Clarified the Diagnostics probe table labels from `Severity`/`Last result` to `Risk severity`/`Last runtime result`. Probe semantics remain unchanged: a critical-risk probe can legitimately have a passing latest run. | Implemented locally | Re-capture the Diagnostics page and verify the labels prevent confusion without changing probe status or severity. |
| PHASE-1.23 monitor runtime identity | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Added bounded runtime identity to loader context and QM output: plugin/PHP version, OPcache availability, release hash and short hashes for main/collector/panel/registry/source-deployed compat artifacts. Missing files remain `unknown`; no loading decision changed. | Implemented locally / runtime evidence pending | Deploy the hook panel/output with the same release, then compare runtime identity hashes across source/deployed and regular/compat requests. |
| PHASE-1.23 version authority parity | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Removed the stale compat version `1.0.1`; main and both compat paths now use canonical `1.3.7` and expose `BIZCITY_TWIN_AI_VERSION_SOURCE` (`compat_constant` or `main_constant`). Runtime identity renders `version_source` so early constant shadowing is visible. | Implemented locally / artifact parity pending | Deploy main plus the active compat copy together; verify runtime `plugin=1.3.7`, `version_source=compat_constant`, and compare all artifact hashes. |
| PHASE-1.23 Automation surface gate | `R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-DDV` | Replaced the broad `$_bizcity_admin_ctx` Automation bootstrap gate with an explicit resolver for `bizcity-automation` admin, `bizcity-automation/v1` REST, `/flow`, webhook, cron and CLI surfaces. Unconditional cron schedule-name registration remains intact. | Implemented locally / runtime evidence pending | Recapture Diagnostics/unrelated admin versus Automation page/REST/webhook/cron and verify the `core:automation` pre-plugin bucket drops only on unrelated surfaces. |
| WebChat bootstrap | `modules.webchat.json` | `ensure_tables_exist()` no longer runs schema checks on ordinary frontend HTML; `SHOW TABLES` callers use metadata helper. | Fixed | Keep frontend, REST, webhook and cron checks separate in regression tests. |
| Compat loader | `R-PERF.5` in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Intent, Knowledge, Twin Core and Market preloads are gated; deployed and source compat loaders are both tracked. | Fixed | Check both loader copies after every sync/deploy change. |
| Metadata helper | `R-PERF.5` | `information_schema` fallback uses blog/database-aware `wp_cache`, caches false, and performs no `update_option()` on a hot-path miss. | Fixed | Use canonical helper for all new table/column checks. |
| Automation Calendar REST | `core.automation.json` + `R-PERF.5` | Raw `SHOW TABLES` replaced with `bizcity_tbl_exists()` and a blog/database-aware fallback. | Fixed | Add REST request-count evidence when the endpoint is changed. |
| Channel identity caches | `core.channel-gateway.json` + `R-PERF.5` | Identity Hub and Channel User Linker memo keys now include blog/database; false results are preserved. | Fixed | Re-check cache isolation after shard/router changes. |
| ZNS Rules | `modules.zns-automation.json` | Changelog normalized to schema-v1; runtime cache preserves false and includes blog/database. | Fixed | Run schema validator and diagnostics probe. |
| BizCoach Pro | `bizcoach.astro.json` + `R-PERF.5` | Stable `BCPRO_VERSION`; legacy cron cleanup and Astro Checklist repair moved off frontend bootstrap. | Fixed | Audit remaining legacy `bccm_*` ownership before adding schema rows. |
| BZCC/BZDOC/BZPB installers | `modules.bzcc.json` + R-DCL debt list | Schema self-healing is restricted to admin/REST/cron/CLI; public route registration remains intact. | Fixed | Create canonical changelogs only after table registry/schema ownership is complete. |
| Tool Image | R-DCL debt list + `R-PERF.5` | Removed redundant file-scope `upgrade.php`; installer loads it immediately before `dbDelta()`. | Fixed | Catalog all BZTIMG tables before any schema change. |
| Diagnostics graph | `R-PERF.5` | Full probe graph no longer loads on unrelated REST requests; retained for admin/CLI/diagnostics namespace. | Fixed | Lazy-load further by diagnostics screen when admin memory is measured. |
| Frontend baseline preload | `R-PERF.5` | Scheduler, Memory, Agents, Runtime, Skills, Persona, TwinChat, TwinShell, TwinSearch and Doc/Image/Page Builder full runtimes are now route/context-gated; `/gpt/`, `/twin/`, `/twinchat/`, `/scheduler/`, `/skills/` and tool routes remain explicit exceptions. | Fixed locally | Re-measure frontend HTML and wp-admin separately; split TwinWeb public shortcode bootstrap before gating it. |
| LLM client preload | `R-PERF.5` | `core/bizcity-llm/bootstrap.php` is now gated in the main plugin and both compat-loader copies; plain frontend HTML no longer loads the gateway client graph. | Fixed locally | Verify OPcache/deployed loader parity and measure a fresh PHP worker. |
| Metadata cold misses in Query Monitor | `R-PERF.5` + `R-METADATA-CACHE` | Astro Checklist table check and Rolling/Episodic `identity_uuid` checks now use version fast paths plus blog/database-aware fallback caches, including cached false results. | Fixed locally | Re-run the same request and confirm rows 1–3 disappear when schema options are current; repair context may still issue one metadata query. |
| Facebook widget option scan | `R-PERF.5` + `R-CACHE` | `BizCity_FB_Chat_Widget::get_any_enabled()` no longer scans the options table on every `wp_footer`; it uses blog/database-scoped object + transient cache and invalidates after REST save. | Fixed locally | Confirm the `LIKE 'bizcity_cg_fb_widget_%'` query appears only on cold-cache rebuild. |
| Facebook widget exact option index | `R-PERF.5` + `R-CACHE` | Added autoloaded `bizcity_cg_fb_widget_active_page`; normal frontend lookup now uses exact `get_option()` plus one page-specific option read. Prefix `LIKE` scan remains only as migration fallback for legacy sites. | Fixed locally | Save widget settings once or let the first legacy fallback backfill the index, then confirm the `LIKE` query disappears. |
| Diagnostics probe loader | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF.5` | Diagnostics probes are queued at bootstrap and loaded once only for the Diagnostics screen, `bizcity-diagnostics/v1` REST namespace, or WP-CLI. Probe IDs, order, interface and registration filter remain unchanged. | Fixed locally | Re-measure unrelated admin pages, Diagnostics screen and Smoke REST after deploy; verify source/deploy tracer parity. |
| Loader Hook Observability Panel | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-HOOK` | Added bounded lifecycle snapshots for `plugins_loaded`, `init`, `rest_api_init`, `current_screen`, and `admin_footer`, with normalized callback owner, source group, source-group aggregate and memory delta. `admin_footer` capture now runs before panel render. Added Diagnostics UI injection and admin-only `bizcity-diagnostics/v1/loader/hooks` endpoint. | Fixed locally | Deploy and compare phase deltas against the memory trace; keep caps if panel overhead is measurable. |
| Query Monitor loader integration | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-QM` | Added lazy QM collector `bizcity_loader`, HTML `BizCity Loader` panel, compact REST/AJAX `X-QM-bizcity_loader-*` headers, stage markers, required `qm/output/menus` registration, and bounded admin-default JSONL export for agent/debugger analysis. | Fixed locally | Deploy the updated collector/output/integration, reload OPcache/PHP-FPM, then inspect `qm-loader-snapshots-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` from an admin request. |
| Query Monitor loader integration | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-QM` | Added lazy QM collector `bizcity_loader`, HTML `BizCity Loader` panel, compact REST/AJAX headers, stage markers, menu registration, and opt-in JSONL export. Trace UI now separates new-file module buckets from callback source groups, shows top buckets only, and preserves total-vs-sampled callback counts. | Fixed locally | Deploy the updated panel/collector, run a probe request, then use new-file buckets at `init` and `rest_api_init` as the primary root-cause signal. |
| Composer preload on TwinChat shell | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-COMPOSER` | Composer `vendor/autoload.php` for FPDI/FPDF is no longer loaded at file scope on the TwinChat admin shell or ordinary HTML. It remains enabled for REST, cron, CLI, and PDF/tool surfaces. | Fixed locally | Re-run the same TwinChat admin request and compare peak memory, included files, and declared classes before removing additional core preload. |
| TwinChat shell runtime graph | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-SHELL` | TwinChat admin shell no longer loads `tools/class-diagnostics.php`, `modules/twinsource/bootstrap.php`, or `core/twinbrain/bootstrap.php`. The shell only renders the iframe; iframe/REST/Diagnostics requests retain their existing loaders. | Fixed locally | Re-run the same `admin.php?page=bizcity-twinchat&plugin=twinchat` probe and compare pre-`plugins_loaded`/peak memory, files, and classes. |
| Early preload trace | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-EARLY` | Added admin-default `pre_plugins_loaded` baseline/delta to the Query Monitor loader panel and JSONL snapshot. This exposes compat/plugin file-scope loading that the previous lifecycle trace could not see. | Fixed locally | Reload an admin request without query flags and compare `pre_plugins_loaded` buckets before/after shell gates. |
| Admin-default loader evidence | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-QM` | Loader baseline, stage markers and JSONL snapshot now run by default for admin users with `manage_options`; `?bizcity_qm_probe=1` remains available for non-admin diagnostic requests. | Fixed locally | Reload an admin request without query flags and inspect the loader panel/JSONL snapshot. |
| Early capability fatal regression | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `PHP74-COMPAT` | Admin-default probe baseline no longer calls `current_user_can()` during mu-plugin/file-scope loading. Capability checks remain deferred to post-loader marker/stage/export paths. This avoids entering WordPress capability resolution before the normal user/capability lifecycle. | Fixed locally | Deploy the integration fix and verify the TwinChat admin URL no longer produces the capabilities.php fatal; confirm JSONL still records admin stages. |
| Bundled CRM/BizCoach shell guard | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Added entrypoint guards so bundled `bizcity-twin-crm` and `bizcoach-pro` return early on the default TwinChat admin shell, including alternate/regular-plugin load paths. Dedicated CRM (`plugin=crm`), REST, webhook, cron and public surfaces remain allowed. | Fixed locally | Re-run `pre_plugins_loaded` and confirm `bundle:bizcity-twin-crm` / `bundle:bizcoach-pro` new-file buckets disappear from the default shell. |
| Zalo Bot shell guard | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Added a self-guard to the `bizcity-zalo-bot` entrypoint so a separately active regular-plugin copy cannot preload its bootstrap on the default TwinChat admin shell. Dedicated Zalo admin, REST, webhook, cron and public surfaces remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Reload the same TwinChat shell and confirm `bundle:bizcity-zalo-bot` disappears from `pre_plugins_loaded`. |
| Intent graph on TwinChat shell | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-INTENT` | Fixed the main plugin Intent loader condition so `core/intent/bootstrap.php` is excluded from the TwinChat admin shell. Compat loader already had the shell guard; the main plugin was reintroducing the 64-file graph. REST, webhook, cron, CLI and other admin Intent surfaces remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Re-run `pre_plugins_loaded` and confirm `core:intent` disappears from the default TwinChat shell bucket. |
| Wallet MU runtime split | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-MU` | Wallet MU now skips the TwinChat shell, defers REST controllers to `rest_api_init`, network/admin pages to their menu hooks, and product-credit fields to the product screen. Woo checkout/payment/referral/account/cron hooks remain loaded. | Fixed locally | Compare TwinChat shell and frontend HTML traces; separately verify wallet REST, network admin, product edit, checkout and cron. |
| BizCity Web Odoo admin split | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-MU` | Deferred the two Odoo app-catalog function files from every request to `network_admin_menu`/`admin_menu`; clone, OAuth provisioning, public shortcode and duplicate operations remain in the existing path. | Fixed locally | Compare ordinary frontend/REST/cron traces and verify network/site app-catalog pages. |
| Facebook Bot shell guard | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Added self-guards to the Facebook Bot entrypoint and alternate bootstrap so the Messenger/Page runtime is not preloaded by the TwinChat shell; webhook, OAuth, REST, cron and dedicated admin remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Confirm `bundle:bizcity-facebook-bot` disappears from `pre_plugins_loaded`. |
| CF7/TTCK shell guards | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Added exact TwinChat-shell guards to Contact Form 7 and the TTCK Woo payment plugin. Public forms, checkout/payment AJAX, REST, cron and dedicated admin pages remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Confirm `plugin:contact-form-7` and `plugin:thanh-toan-chuyen-khoan` disappear from the shell trace. |
| Doc/Content Creator shell guards | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Added self-guards to Doc Studio and Content Creator entrypoints so their 17-file runtime graphs are not loaded by the TwinChat shell. `/doc`, `/tool-doc`, `/tool-content-creator`, REST/AJAX, cron, CLI and dedicated admin surfaces remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Confirm `bundle:bizcity-doc` and `bundle:bizcity-content-creator` disappear from `pre_plugins_loaded`. |
| Video Kling shell guard | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Added self-guards to Video Kling entrypoint and bootstrap so the 21-file video/FFmpeg/TTS graph is not loaded by the TwinChat shell. `/kling-video`, `/video-editor`, REST/AJAX, cron, CLI and dedicated admin surfaces remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Confirm `bundle:bizcity-video-kling` disappears from `pre_plugins_loaded`. |
| Wallet REST partial-deploy guard | `R-GW-8` + `R-PERF-LOADER-MU` | Wallet REST controllers now require readable artifacts and boot only available classes, so a missing `class-plans-proxy-rest.php` cannot turn unrelated Doc/KG/CRM REST requests into HTTP 500. Restore the missing artifact separately to recover the Wallet proxy route. | Fixed locally | Deploy the bootstrap plus missing controller, then retest `/bzdoc/v1/list`, `/bizcity/kg/v1/notebooks`, and `/bizcity-crm/v1/admin-chat-grants/version`. |
| Admin Menu Editor shell guard | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Admin Menu Editor now skips only the TwinChat iframe shell before loading its dependency graph; Network Admin and all dedicated WordPress admin pages remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Confirm `plugin:admin-menu-editor` disappears from the TwinChat shell trace and Network Admin still renders normally. |
| Agent Market shell guard | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Agent Market now skips only the TwinChat iframe shell before loading its 11-file graph; public marketplace pages, shortcodes, REST/AJAX, cron and Network Admin remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Confirm `plugin:bizcity-agent-market` disappears from the TwinChat shell trace. |
| Login with Google shell guard | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Login with Google now skips Composer/plugin runtime only on the TwinChat iframe shell; wp-login, frontend OAuth, callbacks and settings pages remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Confirm `plugin:login-with-google` disappears from the TwinChat shell trace and Google login still works outside it. |
| Page Builder shell guard | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Page Builder now skips its 10-file editor/runtime graph only on the TwinChat iframe shell; `/tool-pagebuilder`, REST/AJAX, cron, CLI and dedicated admin pages remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Confirm `bundle:bizcity-pagebuilder` disappears from the TwinChat shell trace. |
| Page Builder/WP Crontrol shell guards | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Page Builder and WP Crontrol now skip their editor/cron-admin graphs only on the TwinChat iframe shell; Page Builder routes/REST/AJAX and WP Crontrol admin/cron behavior remain enabled elsewhere. | Fixed locally | Confirm `bundle:bizcity-pagebuilder` and `plugin:wp-crontrol` disappear from the shell trace. |
| Transposh translation shell guards | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Transposh and its Language Switcher now skip translation/parser/widget runtime only on the TwinChat iframe shell; frontend translation/rewrite, translation AJAX, cron and dedicated admin settings remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Confirm `plugin:transposh-translation-filter-for-wordpress` and `plugin:language-switcher-for-transposh` disappear from the shell trace. |
| BizCity Web MU shell guard | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-MU` | BizCity Web clone/OAuth/app-catalog runtime now skips only the TwinChat iframe shell; frontend shortcodes, clone/AJAX, OAuth provisioning and Network Admin remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Confirm `mu:bizcity-web` disappears from the shell trace and network clone pages still render. |
| OAuth Server shell guard | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | OAuth Server now skips its OAuth2/autoprovision graph only on the TwinChat iframe shell; `/oauth`, `/.well-known`, REST bearer authentication, callbacks and OAuth admin pages remain enabled. | Fixed locally | Confirm `plugin:bizgpt-oauth-server-new` disappears from the shell trace and OAuth flows still work outside it. |
| User-role/Admin Bar MU shell split | `R-PERF-LOADER-MU` | User-role repair skips its profile/admin graph on the TwinChat shell. Admin Bar keeps the global `pre_get_blogs_of_user` loop protection but skips custom Recent Sites rendering and user-meta tracking on the shell. | Fixed locally | Confirm residual user-role/Admin Bar callbacks drop while multisite protection remains active. |
| Phone auth/User sync MU shell split | `R-PERF-LOADER-MU` | Phone login/OTP/Woo My Account hooks and BizGPT user/password/global-meta sync hooks now skip only the TwinChat shell; login, registration, profile and multisite sync remain enabled outside it. | Fixed locally | Confirm `mu:bizcity-myaccount-phone.php` and `mu:biz-id.php` residual callbacks drop without affecting auth/profile flows. |
| Legacy Custom Flows shell guard | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Deprecated `bizgpt-custom-flows` now skips its handler/shortcode graph only on the TwinChat iframe shell; legacy flow listeners, shortcodes, admin editor and cron remain enabled elsewhere. | Fixed locally | Confirm `plugin:bizgpt-custom-flows` disappears from the shell trace before considering removal/migration. |
| Dino-site plugin shell guards | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` | Added exact TwinChat-shell guards to Dino points/order tooling, Product Import/Export for WooCommerce, BizGPT Voucher, and Mabel Wheel. Public/order/checkout/AJAX and dedicated admin behavior remain enabled outside the shell; Mabel file-scope table DDL is skipped on the shell. | Fixed locally | On Dino site, confirm `bizgpt-dino-tichdiem`, `product-import-export-for-woo`, `bizgpt-vi-voucher`, and `mabel-wheel-of-fortune` disappear from `pre_plugins_loaded`. |
| Dino guard placement correction | `R-PERF-LOADER-BUNDLE` + `PHP74-COMPAT` | Corrected a context-placement regression: Mabel guard is now outside `MABEL_WOF_auto_loader()`, and Product Import/Export guard is outside its plugin header comment. The old placement could cause Mabel class-load fatal or leave Product Import guard inert. | Fixed locally | Deploy corrected files and confirm no new Mabel fatal plus Dino shell buckets disappear. |
| Admin Bar shell Quick Tools | `R-PERF-LOADER-MU` | TwinChat shell retains a lightweight Quick Tools menu for TwinChat, Channel Gateway, Automation and Diagnostics. It avoids Recent Sites/user_meta/global wp_blogs work; the full My Sites menu remains unchanged outside the shell. | Fixed locally | Confirm Quick Tools appears in the shell and no user-meta/global-site queries are added. |
| Intent graph on unrelated admin pages | `PHASE-1.23-R-PERF-LOADER` + `R-PERF-LOADER-INTENT` | Main and both compat loaders now keep Intent only for backend dispatch, Intent-owned admin/AJAX/public surfaces, and explicit Intent/WebChat pipeline actions; ordinary wp-admin pages no longer preload the full graph. | Fixed locally | Measure ordinary wp-admin, TwinChat/TwinBrain shell, Intent admin page, REST/webhook and cron separately; confirm `core:intent` remains present only where required. |
| Outstanding R-DCL | `core/diagnostics/changelog/` | BZDOC, BZPB and remaining BZTIMG tables need canonical table registry + JSON ownership; BizCoach legacy tables need ownership reconciliation. | Open | Do not invent `since` versions; inventory installer DDL first, then add registry and JSON in one change. |

**Record rule:** Runtime-only performance changes belong in this ledger and
`R-PERF.5`; only table/column/index changes bump a module JSON
`current_version`/`history`. Every schema entry must pass the canonical
validator before merge.

### Memory unify progress and DDV — 2026-07-31
- **PASS:** `modules.zalobot.memory_unify` verifies the active ZaloBot staging contract: canonical TwinBrain writer call, normalized channel context, and rollback-controlled legacy writer flag. No LLM call or persistent write is performed by this probe.
- **PASS:** `twinbrain.memory.hub-rest` verifies mirror wiring plus POST/GET/PUT/DELETE `/memory/me` round-trip and sentinel cleanup.
- **Completed:** memory quarantine/inventory hardening, canonical writer context helper, Zalo staging wiring, REST/Notes mirror delete wiring, and the active diagnostics contracts are documented in [PHASE-MEMORY-UNIFY-ANALYSIS.md](core/memory/docs/PHASE-MEMORY-UNIFY-ANALYSIS.md).
- **Still blocked:** legacy Zalo writer shutdown, session/note read-policy decision, REST unified read cutover, EXPLAIN benchmark, historical backfill, write-cutover flag, and D7 rename/drop. No destructive migration was performed.

### Diagnostics and production triage — 2026-07-28
- **PASS:** `twinbrain.memory.writer.llm` now completes Mode 2 extraction with a unique per-run probe payload; the probe no longer collides with the writer's identity-scoped 24-hour dedupe transient. The latest runtime result persisted 4 extracted rows, including a `preference` row.
- **Fixed:** `core/intent/bootstrap.php` now guards Rolling/Episodic memory initialization with `class_exists()` and records an artifact/load-order error instead of producing a Class-not-found fatal when a memory file is missing or invalid.
- **Improved diagnostics:** Rolling and Episodic schema migration failures now include a bounded `db_error` reason in the PHP log, without logging SQL, credentials, or PII. This is needed to distinguish routed DDL refusal, read-only shards, missing ALTER privileges, and silent `dbDelta()` no-op behavior.
- **Validated locally:** touched PHP files have balanced braces and VS Code diagnostics report no errors. PHP CLI syntax validation is unavailable in the local environment.
- **OPEN — production artifact:** production still reports a parse error in `core/knowledge/includes/class-user-memory.php` at line 733, while the local file is structurally complete. Production file hash/deploy parity and OPcache/PHP-FPM refresh remain unverified; this is not considered resolved by local validation.
- **OPEN — tenant schema:** multiple tenant tables still lack `identity_uuid` in `bizcity_memory_rolling` and `bizcity_memory_episodic`. The migration/backoff prevents request storms but does not make the DDL succeed. The next production log must capture the new `db_error` field before choosing a router/privilege/read-only fix.
- **OPEN — retrieval hydration:** `twinbrain.retrieval.hydration` remains `CRITICAL`/not executed in the latest Diagnostics screen. The KG filestore fallback patch is present locally, but runtime PASS evidence is still missing.
- **Scope:** `store_locations` remains intentionally out of scope for this triage.

### Added — TwinBrain + TwinCore canon documentation pass (2026-06-03)
- Restructured BRAIN-SESSIONS group: moved `class-twinbrain-sessions-manager.php` + `class-twinbrain-sessions-rest.php` into [core/twinbrain/includes/sessions/](core/twinbrain/includes/sessions/) and feature design doc into [core/twinbrain/docs/sessions/](core/twinbrain/docs/sessions/).

- `CHANGELOG.md` + `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `SECURITY.md` + 3 `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` files + `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` cho OSS hygiene.

### Changed
- [`core/knowledge/includes/functions.php`](core/knowledge/includes/functions.php) canonical filter đổi sang `bizcity_after_handle_guest_flows`; legacy `bizgpt_after_handle_guest_flows` vẫn applied (back-compat) + emit deprecation notice via `BizCity_Deprecation::notify_filter()`. Sẽ remove ở 2.0.0.
- [`core/helper-legacy/flows/legacy_bizgpt_facebook.php`](core/helper-legacy/flows/legacy_bizgpt_facebook.php) `twf_handle_facebook_multi_page_post()` chuyển sang `BizCity_Deprecation::notify()` (fallback `_doing_it_wrong()` khi class chưa load).

### Removed
- Bundled vertical plugins moved to `plugins/_archived/` (no longer auto-loaded):
  - `bizcity-automation` → replaced by `core/automation/` (native xyflow runtime, BE-1..BE-5 shipped 2026-05-29).
  - `bizcity-tool-mindmap` → mindmap functionality moved to `bizcity-doc` (Phase 6.3 PHASE-0.7-DOCGEN).

## Versioning policy

- **MAJOR** (`x.0.0`) — breaking changes to public contracts (`BizCity_*_Interface`), namespace removal, hook signature break.
- **MINOR** (`1.x.0`) — new features, new modules, new hooks (additive only). Sub-plugin author không cần đổi code.
- **PATCH** (`1.0.x`) — bug fix, internal refactor, perf. Hook signature giữ nguyên.

Deprecated APIs giữ ≥ 1 minor version với `BizCity_Deprecation::notify()` warning trước khi remove.
