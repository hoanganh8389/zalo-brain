# BizCity Zalo Personal & OA Gateway

> **Axis (supreme):** [R-TWIN-AGENT-AXIS](../../docs/rules/PHASE-0-RULE-TWIN-AGENT-AXIS.md). For zalo-hub numbers this plugin is the client side of the Twin Agent Axis: it hosts the pack routes (`zalo-bridge/packs`, `projection-pack@1`), owner verification (R-SETUP-4 step ③), the `owner_agent` bundle block, and the CRM record. It never answers a turn. Lane: [PHASE-0.87 · 20-LANE-CL](../../core/channel-gateway/docs/PHASE-0.87-OWNER-AGENT-VERTICAL-TOOLS/20-LANE-CL-CLIENT.md).

> **Primary implementation focus:** Zalo Personal is the first-class channel
> for the current product cycle. QR/session ownership, cross-site reconciliation,
> reliable inbound normalization, media/caption fidelity and CRM sending are
> the acceptance baseline. Zalo OA and Facebook/Fanpage are business-owned
> channels that follow; Zalo Bot, Telegram and TwinChat remain supporting/admin
> integrations. Do not weaken the shared channel contracts or create a private
> Personal-only brain while prioritizing this channel.

Connects a personal Zalo account (QR login via the `zca-bridge` sidecar) and a
Zalo Official Account (OAuth v4 + webhook MAC signature) into
`core/channel-gateway` and the `bizcity-twin-crm` Inbox.

- **Framework contract:** [manifest.json](manifest.json) declares this
  plugin's capabilities. See

  the canonical extension shape and validation command

  (`BIZCITY_CHANNEL_GATEWAY_LOADED` guard).

- **Deployment instruction:** the parent workspace instruction
  `.github/instructions/zalo-personal-vps-deployment.instructions.md` applies
  to this plugin. When this folder is opened alone, use the local shim at

Zalo Personal is a Zone 1 customer channel per R-ZONE; do not route it into
Zone 2 admin/command handling.
